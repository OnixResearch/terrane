# Terrane

Natural, composable verified-logic building blocks for reliable systems.
Terrane collects reusable proofs, specs, and runtime code that stays
mechanically checked.

The house style is a `spec fn` (mathematical definition) plus an
`exec fn` whose `ensures result == spec(args)` clause is verified by
[Verus](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/guide/). The specs are embedded
directly in `src/`; tracked exceptions such as `src/ssa_construction.rs`
are listed in `openspec/specs/verification-gaps/spec.md` so any weaker
bridge stays explicit. Requirement coverage is tracked by
[Tracey](https://tracey.bearcove.eu/).

**11139 Verus proofs · 5223 tests · 2270 requirements · 624 modules · 16 trusted/proof-gap boundaries**

Terrane is an active research library. APIs, proof inventories, and verifier
pins may evolve; each verification claim remains scoped to the exact source,
assumptions, trusted boundaries, and toolchain recorded by its evidence.

Historical proof receipts and versioned `trellis-*` policy and consumer-profile
identifiers retain their original identity; this rename does not regenerate
their proofs or make private source revisions publicly accessible.

**Public source snapshot; NOT RELEASE-ADMITTED.** The independently derived
history withholds original private ancestry. Operational dependencies are pinned
to public source snapshots; the UCAN-facing profile binds an anonymously fetched,
immutable Terrane source. Source availability and profile alignment do not confer
downstream correctness or release eligibility.

Recorded Aeneas and May 17 receipts retain their exact source and provider identities.
The current verifier upgrade does not regenerate those receipts.
The May 17 comparison now uses the immutable pre-upgrade source.

The maintained Cairn overlay passed the pinned public CLI's native validation and
proposal/design/tasks gates; specification sync and archive completed for the
[public-source change](.cairn/archive/2026-10-14-publish-independent-public-source/).
These lifecycle receipts do not establish proof or product release admission.

The public-provider Octet run reaches actual linting but rejects the maintained
baseline: `4103` warnings, `3872` new findings and `0` currently accepted findings.
The accepted baseline and lint policy remain unchanged; resolving that rejection
is a separate release-readiness requirement, not a source-availability claim.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
verified-logic = { git = "https://github.com/OnixResearch/terrane" }
```

```rust
use verified_logic::arithmetic::abs_diff;
use verified_logic::bounds::clamp;
use verified_logic::drain::can_start_op;
use verified_logic::quorum::majority;

let d = abs_diff(10, 3);       // 7
let c = clamp(15, 0, 10);      // 10
let m = majority(5);           // 3
let ok = can_start_op(false);  // true (not draining)
```

For normal `cargo build`, the `vstd` crate erases all ghost code. Specs,
proofs, preconditions, and postconditions add no runtime cost. See
[docs/runtime-cost.md](docs/runtime-cost.md) for reproducible normal-build
evidence records.

## Runnable examples

Each runtime example compiles through normal Cargo without invoking Verus. For
Verus-focused spec/exec/ensures walkthroughs, see
[docs/proof-examples.md](docs/proof-examples.md).

- [`examples/core_basics.rs`](examples/core_basics.rs): `cargo run --example core_basics`
- [`examples/bounded_modular_tree_fold.rs`](examples/bounded_modular_tree_fold.rs): `cargo run --example bounded_modular_tree_fold`
- [`examples/consensus_admission.rs`](examples/consensus_admission.rs): `cargo run --example consensus_admission`
- [`examples/ucan_web_of_trust.rs`](examples/ucan_web_of_trust.rs): `cargo run --example ucan_web_of_trust`
- [`examples/r1cs_single_row.rs`](examples/r1cs_single_row.rs): `cargo run --example r1cs_single_row`
- [`examples/storage_allocator.rs`](examples/storage_allocator.rs): `cargo run --example storage_allocator`
- [`examples/integration_adapters.rs`](examples/integration_adapters.rs): `cargo run --example integration_adapters`

## How it works

```rust
verus! {

// Mathematical definition (ghost code, erased at compile time)
pub open spec fn abs_diff_spec(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
    if a >= b { (a - b) as u64 } else { (b - a) as u64 }
}

// Runtime implementation — Verus checks `ensures` against the body
pub fn abs_diff(a: u64, b: u64) -> (result: u64)
    ensures result == abs_diff_spec(a, b)    // ← mechanically checked
{
    if a >= b { a - b } else { b - a }
}

// Machine-checked proof of a property
proof fn abs_diff_symmetric(a: u64, b: u64)
    ensures abs_diff_spec(a, b) == abs_diff_spec(b, a)
{}

} // verus!
```

## Modules

### Composite primitives

The `compose-verified-primitives` OpenSpec change landed twenty thin composition
facades. Each module has a public facade, paired spec predicates, proof bridge,
and positive / negative runtime evidence. Headline counts above are from fresh
validation commands captured in the change evidence.

| Module | Composition purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `durable_job_executor` | durable, idempotent, retry-aware job execution | verified |
| `distributed_lock` | stale-holder-safe lease writes with fencing tokens | verified |

| `crash_safe_page_cache` | WAL-backed dirty-page recovery | verified |
| `verified_lsm_ingest` | flush and compaction-safe LSM ingest | verified |
| `serializable_txn_guard` | MVCC / dependency / 2PL commit admission | verified |
| `web_of_trust_ucan_authorizer` | UCAN authorization plus rooted web-of-trust policy | verified |
| `policy_decision_engine` | delegation, containment, scope, pattern, and trust allow/deny | verified |
| `blocking_bounded_channel` | bounded queue capacity plus futex/backoff waiting | verified |
| `safe_reclamation_domain` | RCU, epoch, hazard-pointer, and ref-count reclamation | verified |
| `cache_coherent_memory_region` | coherence, prefetch, store-buffer, and write-policy invariants | verified |
| `verified_compiler_pipeline` | raw-IR analysis and optimization preservation | verified |
| `backend_frame_allocator` | register/spill stack allocation conflict freedom | verified |
| `dependency_scheduler` | DAG-safe, fair, capacity-bounded job scheduling | verified |
| `raft_membership_manager` | safe config changes, learner promotion, leadership transfer | verified |
| `exactly_once_ledger_transfer` | replay-safe balanced transfer posting | verified |
| `fenced_attempt_admission` | fenced durable-attempt phases, epoch safety, event idempotence, completion linkage, and exact rejection preservation | verified |

| `chaoscontrol_exploration_core` | deterministic, oracle-checked exploration steps | verified |
| `integration_adapters` | deterministic user-facing adapters over verified consensus, UCAN, Nix/Nickel, and WAL primitives | adapter |

The additional `fenced_attempt_admission::verified` decision kernel proves
specification/executable equality over seven phase and report kinds, caller-
classified event relations, fence/attempt identity, worker/output authority,
and result linkage. Its caller must establish event classification against
complete retained history. This kernel does not prove event digest computation,
history lookup, consumer projection, Mantle runtime equivalence, transport,
storage, verifier soundness, a Valence property receipt, or release eligibility.

## Development

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the public workflow, module template, Tracey annotation rules, proof-gap policy, and baseline/final validation expectations. Use [docs/module-guide.md](docs/module-guide.md) to choose modules by task or problem domain, [docs/module-index.md](docs/module-index.md) for objective module maturity facts, [docs/invariant-surface-catalog.md](docs/invariant-surface-catalog.md) for invariant evidence rows, [docs/proof-evidence-bundles.md](docs/proof-evidence-bundles.md) for downstream evidence export, [docs/proof-evidence-ir-chain.json](docs/proof-evidence-ir-chain.json) for linked verifier-receipt evidence chains, [docs/kani-boundary.md](docs/kani-boundary.md) for complementary Kani evidence boundaries, [docs/proof-artifact-manifest.md](docs/proof-artifact-manifest.md) for exported primitive manifest rows, [docs/ucan-bridge-coverage.md](docs/ucan-bridge-coverage.md) for UCAN bridge coverage, [docs/verified-logic-consumer-profile.md](docs/verified-logic-consumer-profile.md) for direct dependency and audited vendoring metadata, and [docs/cookbook.md](docs/cookbook.md) for short workflow recipes.

Nix proof checks use locked public inputs and the pinned October Verus archive.
Ordinary Cargo builds use `nightly-2026-10-14` for registered lint tools.
Verus uses its own Rust `1.99.1` toolchain.
Lifecycle changes need the public Cairn CLI and the policy in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For confidential vulnerability reports, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

```bash
nix develop                # enter devshell
pre-commit install         # install the local Octet pre-commit hook
cargo check                # compile (ghost code erased)
cargo test                 # run runtime unit, property, and doc tests
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Verification

Current proofs use Verus `0.2026.10.18.7d82994` and
`vstd = "=0.0.0-2026-10-18-0147"`. Nix checks each platform archive against its pinned SHA-256.
Sail can verify the same library with its compatible Verus fork:

```sh
RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.99.1 sail verify --lib --output json -- \
  --triggers-mode silent --rlimit 20
```

Sail proof reuse needs a Cargo configuration without `build.rustc-wrapper`.
Configuration files in workspace ancestors also apply.
Global Cargo configuration is outside this repository.

With Sail `2293db1`, local verification passed, but repeated runs did not reuse whole-target proofs.
Sail reported new build-script input declarations on each run.

Proof configuration uses the exact reviewed Nickel cohort. See [docs/nickel-toolchain.md](docs/nickel-toolchain.md).

The standalone export rail pins `OnixResearch/nickel-export` revision `257fafc1c746f1faf156207043a4c826bfb16d49`. It compares nine exact outputs and 31 invalid fixtures.

Terrane retains policy, proof, destination, and release authority. The existing checkers remain available through explicit legacy-parity rollback modes.

See [docs/nickel-export-cutover.md](docs/nickel-export-cutover.md) for the checked profile, commands, and non-claims.

The Aeneas pilot selects only `src/arithmetic.rs::abs_diff` from normal Cargo macro erasure. It does not use a copied Rust function.

The historical Aeneas pilot records Octet revision `890f424cd7b1b2015f39c0eb5747f1bd1e576028`; `flake.nix` selects its independently published public source for acquisition. Frozen receipts are not relabelled as current-source admission.

Charon emits one non-errorful LLBC declaration. Aeneas maps it to `verified_logic.arithmetic.abs_diff` in one generated Lean file.

Lean checks separate symmetry and self-zero theorems. The trust audit records `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` for the selected declarations.

The false theorem fails in Lean. Octet's adequacy policy rejects the vacuous theorem before proof promotion.

The Terrane receipt and cross-verifier manifest bind exact BLAKE3 identities. They do not merge Verus and Aeneas authority or claim semantic equivalence.

See [docs/aeneas-cross-verifier-pilot.md](docs/aeneas-cross-verifier-pilot.md) for scope, commands, identities, and non-claims.

`upstream-verus-corpus/catalog.ncl` pins source snapshots for verifier-upgrade
regression selection. Its source-intake check validates exact fixed-output
hashes, license files, and sentinels; it does not run or import upstream proofs.
Promotion to Terrane formal evidence still requires an exact local verifier run,
assumption account, source/proof/tool bindings, and Terrane-owned receipt.

The May 17 comparison uses immutable Terrane source
`65058ec60d69e405ffd324c44cf9fcba5177d453`.
It retains the original verifier pins, corpus patches, negative controls, and expected results.
It does not certify the October verifier or the updated source.

| Historical cohort | Expected verified count |
|---|---:|
| March verifier, pinned Terrane snapshot | 11142 |
| May verifier, pinned Terrane snapshot | 11142 |
| Adapted IronKV | 312 |
| Adapted verified-memory-allocator | 732 |
| Unmodified verified-node-replication | 254 |

The SOSP microcases remain diagnostic-only. VerusBelt remains a Rocq reference audit.
Adapted-source results do not certify the unmodified upstream revisions.

The default proof check and wrapper use the Terrane-owned package in `nix/verus.nix`.
Its October verifier and Rust `1.99.1` are independent of the historical Octet provider.


The formatter still uses Octet's revision-bound `verusfmt` and typed profile.
`upstream-verus-corpus/verusfmt-baseline.txt` remains the exact migration ratchet.
A new nonconforming file, stale baseline entry, or profile drift fails.
The formatter's May compatibility identity does not certify October proofs.


The Octet check uses `octet-baseline.json` to accept current warning-level
findings while rejecting any new unbaselined stable finding ID. The local
pre-commit hook delegates to that same pinned Nix check.

## Structure

```
src/lib.rs              ← crate root, 604 public module declarations
src/<module>.rs         ← spec fn + exec fn + proof fn + #[cfg(test)] tests
docs/requirements.md    ← canonical requirement prose and Tracey anchors
scripts/verus.sh        ← pinned Verus package resolver
scripts/verify.rs       ← full verification pipeline
scripts/check-*.rs      ← annotation enforcement
```

Most modules follow the same pattern (tracked exceptions are listed in
`openspec/specs/verification-gaps/spec.md`):

1. `pub open spec fn *_spec(...)` — mathematical definition with `r[depends]` annotation
2. `pub fn *(...)` with `ensures result == *_spec(args)` — runtime code with `r[impl]` annotation
3. `proof fn` — properties of the spec with `r[verify]` annotation
4. `#[cfg(test)]` — unit tests and proptest property tests

## Trusted and proof-gap items

`16` items are marked `#[verifier::external_body]` across `6` files. The
previous `src/instruction_selection.rs` runtime-only public API exemptions now
have direct Tracey implementation and test coverage.

**16 permanent** (architectural trust boundaries):

- **4 legacy cryptographic hash axioms / exec bridges** (`chain.rs`,
  `snapshot_integrity.rs`) — BLAKE3-style hashing is modeled with
  uninterpreted specs plus trusted collision-resistance/runtime wrappers;
  equal-input determinism now follows directly from pure spec equality.
- **1 version comparison bridge** (`nix_version.rs`) — the recursive `cv_fuel`
  proof lemmas are now internalized, while the exec/spec connection still
  exceeds solver budget.
- **10 UCAN codec/signature bridges** (`ucan_did.rs`, `ucan_signature.rs`) —
  base58btc and Ed25519 behavior is modeled behind external codec/crypto
  contracts; `ucan_cid.rs` now composes its CID multibase round-trip model from
  the shared DID base58btc contract instead of carrying a separate CID axiom,
  and public DID decode now composes verified prefix, base58, varint, and
  key-suffix primitives around the remaining base58btc contract. Base58btc
  decode also performs verified alphabet screening before the trusted codec
  core. UCAN signature byte-level entrypoints now reject malformed key/signature
  lengths through verified constructors before invoking trusted Ed25519 crypto.
- **1 web-of-trust crypto bridge** (`web_of_trust_principal.rs`) — principal
  digest derivation stays behind a trusted runtime/model boundary; attestation
  and revocation signature-input construction and comparison are now verified
  from canonical bytes.

**0 closeable** — the former runtime-only public APIs in
`src/instruction_selection.rs` now have direct Tracey implementation and test
coverage for their well-formedness, matching, tiling, coverage, soundness,
projection, evaluation, and validity contracts.
Def-site collection, IDF computation, SSA-property checking, and phi elimination
are internalized now; runtime tests and manual oracles still cover the stronger
remaining SSA semantic claims.

In addition to `external_body`, the current audit also tracks:

- `0` `assume_specification[...]` exec bridges
- `0` runtime-only `@verified-logic:exempt` public API proof gaps
- `0` `@verified-logic:no-ensures` markers
- `0` `assume(...)` soundness oracles
- `0` placeholder-spec surfaces

All trusted/proof-gap items remain listed in `openspec/specs/verification-gaps/spec.md`, and `docs/proof-gap-sites.tsv` is the checked per-site source for exact trusted-boundary rationale.

## License

Terrane project source is offered under `MPL-2.0`; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Modifications to covered files remain available under MPL terms, while a larger work may keep separate files under other licenses subject to the MPL.

The crate's `MPL-2.0` metadata does not relicense copied third-party material.
The [Cairn policy projection](cairn-policy/UPSTREAM.md) and pinned
[Nickel authoring inputs](cairn-policy/upstream-source/) have a subsequent
[license grant for their exact historical blobs](cairn-policy/LICENSING.md).
Terrane selects MIT for those copies and includes the
[Cairn copyright notice and license text](LICENSES/Cairn-MIT.txt). The earlier
[AGPL license text](LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt) remains available as an
alternative; the [checked import procedure](cairn-policy/sync-cairn-source.py)
preserves the original source identities. The Cairn CLI/export toolchain and
private history are not bundled or relicensed by this choice.
Machine-checked properties are bounded to the admitted source, verifier,
assumptions, and receipts; license metadata does not certify downstream behavior
or transfer whole-system proof authority.

- [`stonysystems/jetpack` at `c03e318ec355b11edd42aac56c68d0765f88d1d2`](https://github.com/stonysystems/jetpack/tree/c03e318ec355b11edd42aac56c68d0765f88d1d2) and the [OSDI 2026 paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi26-tang.pdf) — pinned MIT-licensed design, TLA+, and fault-scenario references for reusable crash-fault fast-path proof obligations; external proofs, implementation behavior, and benchmark claims do not transfer to Terrane.
- [AeneasVerif/aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas) at `bc2eb6f941369fa3c695e30598b5758b11e4f0de` and [OnixResearch/octet](https://github.com/OnixResearch/octet) at `890f424cd7b1b2015f39c0eb5747f1bd1e576028` — exact-source Aeneas/Lean provider and consumer-contract references; their evidence remains separately scoped and does not establish semantic equivalence or verifier soundness.
- [HigherOrderCO/Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend) at `814453670d0e0d6777c1313c972764dba0491b7f` — Apache-2.0 external reference for a bounded `u24` balanced-reduction conformance profile; no language, compiler, runtime, or benchmark claim transfers.
- [HigherOrderCO/HVM2](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM2) at `654276018084b8f44a22b562dd68ab18583bfb5b` — Apache-2.0 external reference for the evaluated CPU runtime cohort; no interaction-net, scheduling, generated-code, or runtime-correctness claim transfers.
- [rustc-dev-guide: Implicit caller location](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/implicit-caller-location.html) — design reference for finite caller-location metadata and reify-shim behavior only; no rustc implementation or codegen claim transfers.
- [rustc-dev-guide: Attribute Parsing](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/hir/attribute-parsing.html) — design reference for inert parser classes and policy metadata only; no macro, token-parser, diagnostics, stabilization, or frontend claim transfers.
- [rustc-dev-guide: Libraries and metadata](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/backend/libs-and-metadata.html) — design reference for rlib/dylib/rmeta capabilities, rustc identity fields, encoded MIR, and pipelining only; no archive, hash-security, linker, LTO, or build-system claim transfers.
- [OnixResearch/nickel-export](https://github.com/OnixResearch/nickel-export) at `257fafc1c746f1faf156207043a4c826bfb16d49` — exact export, identity, diagnostic, and freshness mechanism; Terrane policy, proof, and release authority do not transfer.
