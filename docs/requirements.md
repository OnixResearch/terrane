# Trellis Requirements

This document defines the requirements for Trellis, the `verified-logic` Rust library.
Every requirement has a Tracey ID and maps to verified Rust code.

## Bitwise

(exactly one bit set). Zero MUST return false.

r[bitwise.bit-at]
bit_at MUST return true if and only if the bit at the given position is set.
Position MUST be in the range [0, 64).

r[bitwise.set-bit]
set_bit MUST return a value with the bit at the given position set to 1,
leaving all other bits unchanged.

r[bitwise.clear-bit]

of value are all copies of bit [width-1]. width MUST be in [1, 64].
is_sign_extended(value, 64) MUST always return true. If
is_sign_extended(value, w1) holds and w2 >= w1, then
is_sign_extended(value, w2) MUST also hold.

Clamp MUST return lo when value < lo, hi when value > hi, and value
otherwise. The result MUST always satisfy in-range(result, lo, hi).

## Collections

r[collections.sorted-insert]
Inserting into a sorted sequence MUST produce a sorted sequence containing
all original elements plus the new element.

r[collections.binary-search]
Binary search on a sorted sequence MUST return the index of the target if
present, or None if absent. It MUST NOT access indices outside the sequence
bounds.

r[collections.merge-sorted]
Merging two sorted sequences MUST produce a sorted sequence whose length
equals the sum of the input lengths.

r[collections.is-partitioned]
is_partitioned MUST return true if and only if all elements below the
threshold precede all elements at or above it. Sorted sequences MUST be
partitioned by any threshold. Empty slices MUST be partitioned.

r[collections.find-first]

None if absent. When found, no earlier index may contain the target.
find_first on an empty slice MUST return None.

count MUST be zero for empty slices. The count MUST never exceed the
slice length.

## Integer

r[integer.is-even]
is_even MUST return true if and only if x is divisible by 2. is_even and

associative, and idempotent. min(a, b) <= max(a, b) MUST hold.

r[ordering.median-of-three]
median_of_three MUST return the middle value of three inputs. The result
MUST be bounded by the overall min and max of the three values. The median
of three equal values MUST be that value.

r[ordering.sign]
sign MUST return -1 if a < b, 0 if a == b, and 1 if a > b.
sign MUST be antisymmetric: sign(a, b) == -sign(b, a).

r[ordering.compare-and-swap]
compare_and_swap MUST return (min(a,b), max(a,b)). The first element MUST
be less than or equal to the second. Both input values MUST be preserved.

## Cross-Module Properties

r[properties.abs-diff-zero-iff-equal]
abs_diff(a, b) MUST equal zero if and only if a equals b.

r[properties.add-sub-roundtrip]
When a + b does not overflow, saturating_sub(saturating_add(a, b), b) MUST
return a. Addition and subtraction MUST be inverse operations within bounds.

r[properties.triangle-inequality]
abs_diff MUST satisfy the triangle inequality: abs_diff(a, c) is less than
or equal to abs_diff(a, b) + abs_diff(b, c) for all a, b, c.

r[properties.clamp-nearest-point]
For any x in [lo, hi], clamp(value, lo, hi) MUST be at least as close to
value as x is. Clamp returns the nearest point in the range.

r[properties.clamp-monotonic]
Clamp MUST be monotonic: if a <= b then clamp(a, lo, hi) <= clamp(b, lo, hi).

r[properties.distance-decomposition]
For any value in [lo, hi], the distances to the endpoints MUST sum to the
range width: abs_diff(value, lo) + abs_diff(value, hi) == abs_diff(lo, hi).

r[properties.sub-add-inverse]
When b <= a, saturating_add(saturating_sub(a, b), b) MUST return a.
Subtraction and addition MUST be inverse operations within bounds.

r[properties.set-clear-roundtrip]
Setting a bit then clearing it MUST leave the bit cleared. Clearing a bit
then setting it MUST leave the bit set. set_bit and clear_bit MUST be
complementary operations on individual bit positions.

r[properties.toggle-involution]
Toggling a bit twice MUST return the original value for any input and
any valid bit position.

r[properties.min-max-abs-diff]
max(a, b) - min(a, b) MUST equal abs_diff(a, b). The gap between min and
max is the absolute difference.

r[properties.clamp-via-min-max]
clamp(v, lo, hi) MUST equal min(max(v, lo), hi) when lo <= hi. Clamp is
expressible as nested min/max.

r[properties.align-down-remainder]
x - align_down(x, a) MUST equal x % a. The distance from x to the
aligned-down value is the remainder.

r[properties.align-up-via-div-ceil]
When align_up(x, a) is defined, it MUST equal div_ceil(x, a) * a. Rounding
up to an alignment is ceiling division times the alignment.

r[properties.median-is-clamp]
median_of_three(a, b, c) MUST equal clamp(a, min(b, c), max(b, c)).
The median is a clamped value.

r[properties.all-equal-implies-count]
If all_equal(s, v) holds, count_matches(s, v) MUST equal s.len(). Every
element matching means the count is the full length.

r[properties.chunk-count-div-ceil]
div_ceil(n, k) MUST equal chunk_count(n, k) + 1 when n has a remainder
mod k, and chunk_count(n, k) when it divides evenly. Floor and ceiling
division differ by exactly the presence of a remainder.

r[properties.narrow-iff-in-range]
narrow_u32(x).is_some() MUST hold if and only if in_range(x, 0, u32::MAX)
holds. Checked narrowing and range predicates MUST agree.

r[properties.all-equal-implies-partitioned]
If all_equal(s, v) holds, is_partitioned(s, threshold) MUST hold for any
threshold. A uniform sequence is trivially partitioned.

r[properties.majority-via-div-ceil]
majority(n) MUST equal div_ceil(n + 1, 2) for all n > 0. The majority
threshold is ceiling division of (n+1) by 2.

r[properties.epoch-ge-term-index]
epoch_ge(a, b) MUST imply a.term > b.term, or a.term == b.term and
a.index >= b.index. The lexicographic comparison decomposes into term
and index conditions.

r[properties.log-prefix-term-eq]
If logs_match_prefix(a, b, k) holds, the term sequences of a and b
MUST be equal over [0, k). Log term-agreement is equivalent to prefix
equality on the projected term sequence.

r[properties.chaoscontrol-subset-replay]
For normalized schedules, if `subset(source, indices)` is replayed from
`cursor = 0` by any nondecreasing time sequence whose final horizon covers all
subset faults, delivered faults MUST appear in the same relative order as in
`source`.

r[properties.chaoscontrol-fingerprint-trace]
For schedulers that start from the same initial state, or the same full
post-`apply_variant` reset state, executions with the same post-advance
turn/quantum trace MUST produce the same fingerprint even if the imperative
shell path differs.

r[properties.chaoscontrol-quorum-gate]
For valid fault states, a healthy-period gate MUST never report healthy unless
the corresponding `quorum_reachable` predicate holds for that same state.

## Consistency Model Vocabulary

r[consistency-vocab.valid-op-kind]
The shared consistency-history vocabulary MUST use four operation tags:
read, write, commit, and abort. Any other tag MUST be rejected.

r[consistency-vocab.op-complete]

r[shamir-reconstruct.correctness]
Reconstruction from k valid shares MUST return the secret encoded by the
threshold polynomial used to generate those shares.

r[shamir-reconstruct.insufficient-shares]
Reconstruction from fewer than k shares SHOULD NOT recover the original
secret except in degenerate low-degree cases.

r[shamir-threshold.information-theoretic-security]
Any k - 1 visible shares MUST be completable to any target secret by adding
a suitable k-th point at x = 0.

r[shamir-threshold.perfect-reconstruction-threshold]
Once the secret point is included, the completed interpolation data MUST
fix a unique secret value.

r[consistency-vocab.history-well-formed]
A history MUST be well formed when every operation in it is complete under

r[consistency-vocab.session-order]
Session order MUST hold from operation `a` to operation `b` exactly when
they belong to the same session, have different operation IDs, and `a`

that write as its observed source on the same object.

r[consistency-vocab.arbitration]

r[consistency-vocab.write-conflict]
Two writes MUST conflict exactly when they touch the same object but come
from different transactions.

r[consistency-vocab.happens-before]

Read uncommitted MUST still forbid dirty writes.

r[consistency-txn.read-committed]
Read committed MUST extend read uncommitted by forbidding dirty reads.

r[consistency-txn.cursor-stability]
Cursor stability MUST extend read committed by protecting cursor-held
objects from concurrent modification.

r[consistency-txn.monotonic-atomic-view]
Monotonic atomic view MUST extend read committed by requiring all-or-none

committed transactions.

r[consistency-txn.dependency-acyclic]
An acyclic transaction-dependency graph MUST be a valid serializability
witness shape.

r[consistency-txn.strict-serializability]
Strict serializability MUST extend serializability with real-time and
per-session program-order respect across transactions.

## Object and Session Consistency Models

r[consistency-object.sequential-witness]

shared read/write operations expressed with the consistency-history
vocabulary.

r[consistency-session.pram]
PRAM MUST require monotonic reads, monotonic writes, and read-your-writes.

r[consistency-session.causal-consistency]
Causal consistency MUST extend PRAM with writes-follow-reads.

## Consistency Refinement and Availability

r[consistency-refinement.model-hierarchy]
The implementation MUST expose proof bridges for the implication edges in
the consistency-model hierarchy.

r[consistency-refinement.availability-envelope]
The implementation MUST classify each modeled consistency level by the
strongest availability envelope assigned in the OpenSpec taxonomy.

## Option Combinators

unwrap_or_default MUST return the contained value if Some, or the provided
default if None.

r[option.map-preserves-none]

equals map(opt, g∘f).

r[option.and-then]
and_then MUST apply `f` to the contained value if Some, returning its
result. and_then on None MUST return None. and_then MUST satisfy the
monad identity laws: and_then(Some(v), f) == f(v) and
and_then(opt, Some) == opt.

r[option.or-else]
or_else MUST return the option unchanged if Some. or_else on None MUST
return the fallback value. or_else with a Some fallback MUST always
yield Some.

## Result Combinators

r[result.unwrap-or]
unwrap_or MUST return the Ok value if present, or the provided default
if Err.

r[result.map-ok]
map_ok MUST apply `f` to the Ok value, leaving Err untouched. map_ok
MUST satisfy the functor composition law. map_ok and map_err MUST
commute: the order of application does not matter.

r[result.map-err]

r[result.and-then]
and_then on Ok(v) MUST apply `f`, returning its result. and_then on

Widening a u32 then narrowing MUST return the original value. Values
above u32::MAX MUST be rejected.

r[conversion.narrow-u16]
narrow_u16 MUST return Some when the input fits in u16, None otherwise.
Widening a u16 then narrowing MUST return the original value. Values
above u16::MAX MUST be rejected.

r[conversion.narrow-u8]
narrow_u8 MUST return Some when the input fits in u8, None otherwise.
Widening a u8 then narrowing MUST return the original value. Values
above u8::MAX MUST be rejected.

r[conversion.signed-to-unsigned]

values, and None for negative values. The i64 → u64 → i64 roundtrip
MUST preserve the value for non-negative inputs.

r[conversion.unsigned-to-signed]
unsigned_to_signed MUST return Some(x as i64) when x <= i64::MAX, and
None otherwise. The u64 → i64 → u64 roundtrip MUST preserve the value
for inputs that fit in i64.

## Expiration

r[expiration.expires-at]
expires_at(now_ms, ttl_seconds) MUST return now_ms + ttl_seconds * 1000,
saturating at u64::MAX on overflow. The result MUST always be >= now_ms.

r[expiration.is-expired]
is_expired(expires_at_ms, now_ms) MUST return true if and only if
now_ms > expires_at_ms. At the exact expiration time, the entry is NOT
expired.

r[expiration.is-expired-opt]
is_expired_opt(expires_at_ms, now_ms) MUST return false when expires_at_ms
is None (no TTL means never expires). When Some, MUST delegate to
is_expired.

r[expiration.time-remaining]
time_remaining(expires_at_ms, now_ms) MUST return None when expires_at_ms
is None. MUST return Some(0) when already expired. MUST return
Some(expires_at - now) when not yet expired.

r[expiration.is-ttl-valid]
is_ttl_valid(ttl_seconds, max_ttl) MUST return true if and only if
ttl_seconds <= max_ttl.

## Chain Hash

r[chain.hash-deterministic]
The hash function MUST be deterministic: same inputs MUST always produce
the same output. Modeled as an uninterpreted function with this axiom.

r[chain.compute-entry-hash]
compute_entry_hash MUST combine prev_hash, log_index, term, and data
into a single hash input and return the hash. The result MUST depend on
all four inputs.

r[chain.chain-valid]
A chain is valid if every entry's hash equals the hash computed from its
predecessor's hash, its index, its term, and its data. The first entry
uses the genesis hash as its predecessor.

r[chain.append-preserves]
Appending a correctly-hashed entry to a valid chain MUST produce a valid
chain. All prior entries MUST remain valid.

r[chain.collision-free]
The hash function MUST be collision-free: if two calls to hash_spec
produce the same output, all four inputs MUST be identical. This is an
idealized cryptographic assumption (trusted axiom) modeling the
collision resistance of Blake3.

r[chain.agreement]
If two valid chains have matching hashes at position k, all entries at
positions 0 through k MUST be identical. This is the fundamental
security guarantee: the hash at any position commits to the entire
chain prefix.

r[chain.divergence-detected]
If two valid chains differ at any position j, their hashes at every
position k >= j MUST differ. Hash chains are tamper-evident: any
modification to any entry is detectable by comparing tip hashes.

r[chain.single-entry-valid]
A single entry correctly hashed from the genesis hash MUST form a
valid chain of length one.

r[chain.tip-commitment]
The chain-tip commitment MUST return the genesis hash for an empty chain
and the final entry hash for a non-empty chain. For a valid chain, the tip
commitment MUST commit to the full prefix under the existing agreement and
collision-free assumptions.

r[chain.extension-prefix]
A chain extension predicate MUST hold exactly when the shorter chain is an
unchanged prefix of the longer chain. Extension MUST remain separate from
hash validity, while valid full chains MUST yield valid selected prefixes.

r[chain.checkpoint-anchor]
A checkpoint anchor over an index and expected hash MUST be valid only when
the chain is valid, the index is in range, and the entry hash at that index
matches the expected hash. Matching checkpoint anchors MUST authenticate the
prefix through that index.

r[chain.fork-detection]
Fork detection MUST identify whether two chains diverge. For valid chains of
the same length, equal tip commitments MUST imply no divergence, and any
entry divergence MUST force different tip commitments.

r[chain.batch-append]
Batch append MUST fold correctly hashed entries over a valid base chain,
preserve validity at each append step, and leave the original prefix
unchanged. Incorrectly hashed batch entries MUST not receive a verified
append-preserves claim.

r[chain.log-shape]
Log-shape predicates MUST be separate from hash validity and MUST cover the
chosen contiguous/increasing index policy plus term policy. Hash validity
alone MUST NOT imply index or term well-formedness.

r[chain.tamper-classification]
Tamper-classification lemmas MUST classify detectable valid-chain divergence
as data identifier, index, term, or predecessor/hash tampering while reusing
existing collision-free, agreement, and divergence facts.

r[chain.domain-separated-hash]
Domain-separated hash input contracts MUST distinguish entry, checkpoint,
receipt, and snapshot-style commitments. A hash from one domain MUST NOT be
accepted as verified evidence for another domain without an explicit
compatibility wrapper.

r[chain.runtime-blake3-alignment]
Runtime chain hashing MUST either use the documented deterministic BLAKE3
serialization boundary or keep any deterministic test-mixer bridge explicit
as a trusted/runtime boundary with no cryptographic-strength claim.

r[chain.compact-history-proof]
An optional compact-history overlay MAY provide skip-link, Merkle, or MMR
membership/range proofs. The overlay MUST compose with base chain tips or
checkpoints and MUST NOT replace or weaken linear chain validity.

## Batch Limits

r[batch.check-limits]
check_limits MUST report whether adding an operation would exceed the
entry count or byte size limit. An empty batch (zero entries) MUST
never report exceeded — the first operation always fits.

r[batch.flush-decision]
flush_decision MUST return Immediate when the batch is full (entries or
bytes), when batching is disabled (immediate mode), or when the batch
is empty. MUST return Delayed when the batch has items but is not full
and no flush is already scheduled. MUST return None when a flush is
already scheduled.

r[batch.op-size]
op_size MUST return key_len + value_len, saturating at u64::MAX.
delete_op_size MUST return key_len.

## Interval

r[interval.contains]
contains(lo, hi, x) MUST return true if and only if lo <= x < hi.
An empty interval (lo >= hi) MUST contain nothing.

r[interval.is-empty]
is_empty(lo, hi) MUST return true if and only if lo >= hi.

r[interval.overlaps]
overlaps(a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) MUST return true if and only if the
intervals share at least one point. Two empty intervals MUST NOT overlap.
Overlap MUST be symmetric.

r[interval.split]
split(lo, hi, mid) MUST produce two intervals [lo, mid) and [mid, hi)
that cover the original without overlap. mid MUST satisfy lo < mid < hi.

r[interval.adjacent]
adjacent(a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) MUST return true if and only if one
interval ends exactly where the other begins. Adjacent MUST be symmetric.

r[interval.merge]
merge(a_lo, a_hi, b_lo, b_hi) MUST combine two adjacent intervals into
one covering both. Merge of a split MUST recover the original.

## Compare-and-Swap

r[cas.check-condition]
check_condition MUST evaluate a typed condition against a current value:
VALUE_EQUALS succeeds when current matches expected, KEY_EXISTS succeeds
when current is Some, KEY_NOT_EXISTS succeeds when current is None.

greater than n. Two quorums of the same set MUST always overlap.

r[quorum.fault-tolerance]

tolerates f failures. min_cluster_size(fault_tolerance(n)) MUST be <= n
for all n > 0.

## Monotonic

r[monotonic.is-advance]
is_advance(old, new) MUST return true if and only if new >= old. Advance
MUST be reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric.

r[monotonic.is-strict-advance]
is_strict_advance(old, new) MUST return true if and only if new > old.
Strict advance MUST be irreflexive and transitive. A strict advance
followed by a non-strict advance MUST still be a strict advance.

## Epoch

r[epoch.cmp]
epoch_cmp MUST compare (term, index) pairs lexicographically: first by
term, then by index. MUST return -1 if a < b, 0 if a == b, 1 if a > b.
The ordering MUST be total, transitive, and antisymmetric.

r[epoch.ge]
epoch_ge(a, b) MUST return true if and only if epoch a is greater than
or equal to b in the lexicographic ordering. This is the vote-granting
predicate: a candidate's log must be at least as up-to-date as the voter's.

## ACID Transaction Properties

r[acid.apply-write]
apply_write MUST update the state at the given index to the new value,
leaving all other positions unchanged. The state length MUST be preserved.
All write indices MUST be within state bounds.

r[acid.commit]
commit (apply_writes) MUST apply all write operations in sequence.
Committing an empty write set MUST return the state unchanged. The
state length MUST be preserved after commit.

reflects every write in order. An aborted transaction MUST leave the
state identical to the original. The state length MUST be preserved.
No partial application is possible.

r[acid.consistency]
Positions not targeted by any write operation MUST retain their original
values after commit. Only explicitly written positions may change.

r[acid.isolation]

MUST produce the same state as applying B then A when their indices
differ. Reading a position not targeted by a write MUST return the
original value.

r[acid.durability]
WAL recovery MUST replay all committed entries and skip uncommitted
entries. Recovering a fully committed WAL MUST produce the same state
as a direct commit. Recovering a fully uncommitted WAL MUST leave
the state unchanged. Recovery MUST preserve state length.

backing a COW value MUST only be freed when no references remain.

r[cow.snapshot-isolation]
After a COW write on shared data, readers MUST see the old value and
the writer MUST see the new value. When exclusive, the writer sees the
new value and no other readers exist.

## Approval

r[approval.count-valid]
count_valid_approvals MUST return the number of entries where both
approved and matches_head_commit are true. The count MUST be less than
or equal to the total length. An empty input MUST yield zero.

r[approval.is-merge-allowed]
is_merge_allowed MUST return true if and only if ci_passed is true AND
valid_count >= required. If CI has not passed, merge MUST NOT be allowed
regardless of approval count.

r[approval.needs-more]
needs_more_approvals MUST return required - valid_count when valid_count
< required, and zero otherwise. The result MUST be zero if and only if
valid_count >= required.

r[approval.has-stale]
has_stale_approvals MUST return true if any entry has approved true but
matches_head_commit false. An empty input MUST return false.

## Bounded Range

or x < upper. An unbounded range MUST contain all x >= lower. An empty
bounded range MUST contain nothing.

r[bounded-range.is-empty]
is_empty MUST return true if and only if the range is bounded and
lower >= upper. Unbounded ranges MUST never be empty.

r[bounded-range.overlaps]
overlaps MUST return true if and only if two non-empty ranges share at
least one point. Overlap MUST be symmetric. Empty ranges MUST NOT
overlap. Two non-empty unbounded ranges MUST always overlap.

r[bounded-range.is-bounded]
is_bounded MUST return true if and only if has_upper is true and
lower < upper. Bounded implies non-empty.

r[bounded-range.restrict]
restrict MUST produce a bounded range with the same lower bound and an
upper bound of new_upper (or min of current and new_upper for already-
bounded ranges). The result MUST be a subset of the input range.

## Chunk

r[chunk.count-ceil]
chunk_count_ceil MUST return the number of chunks needed including a
partial last chunk. MUST use ceiling division without overflow:
if total_size == 0 then 0, else (total_size - 1) / chunk_size + 1.
chunk_size MUST be nonzero.

r[chunk.size-at]
chunk_size_at MUST return the size of the chunk at the given index. All

r[drain.can-start-op]
can_start_op MUST return true if and only if is_draining is false. New
operations MUST NOT be admitted during drain.

r[drain.after-start-op]
after_start_op MUST return in_flight + 1. in_flight MUST be less than
u64::MAX to prevent overflow.

r[drain.after-finish-op]
after_finish_op MUST return in_flight - 1. in_flight MUST be greater
than zero to prevent underflow.

r[drain.is-drain-complete]
is_drain_complete MUST return true if and only if is_draining is true
AND in_flight is zero. Both conditions MUST hold.

r[drain.should-notify]
should_notify MUST return true if and only if is_draining is true,
old_in_flight > 0, and new_in_flight == 0. This detects the transition
when the last operation finishes during drain.

r[drain.start-drain]
start_drain_decision MUST return 0 if already draining, 1 if drain
completes immediately (no in-flight ops), 2 if drain starts but must
wait. The result MUST always be 0, 1, or 2.

## Cache Partitioning

r[cache-partition.isolation]
A lookup for partition P MUST NOT hit a line stored in a way assigned to
partition Q (Q ≠ P). lookup_partitioned MUST only examine ways assigned
to the requesting partition.

r[cache-partition.eviction-containment]
Eviction within partition P MUST only select victim ways assigned to P.
Lines in other partitions MUST be untouched by the eviction.

r[cache-partition.capacity]
The sum of all partition sizes (in ways) MUST equal the total number of
ways. No capacity is lost or double-counted at partition boundaries.

r[cache-partition.assignment]
Every way MUST be assigned to exactly one valid partition. A valid
assignment maps every way to a partition ID in [0, num_partitions).

r[cache-partition.resize]
Resizing a partition MUST invalidate transferred ways before
reassignment. Non-transferred ways MUST remain unchanged in both
assignment and data. Total capacity MUST be preserved.

r[cache-partition.full-equivalence]
A single partition containing all ways MUST behave identically to an
unpartitioned cache: lookup examines all ways and eviction considers
all ways.

## Eviction

r[eviction.should-evict]
should_evict MUST return true if and only if count >= capacity. The
cache is at or over capacity and eviction is needed.

r[eviction.find-lru]
find_lru_candidate MUST return the index of the entry with the smallest
access_time among non-protected entries. MUST return None if all entries
are protected or the slice is empty. When found, the entry at the
returned index MUST NOT be protected and MUST have access_time <= all
other non-protected entries.

r[eviction.cache-valid]
is_cache_valid MUST return true if and only if count <= capacity + 1
AND protected_count <= count. The cache may temporarily exceed capacity
by one before eviction runs.

r[eviction.evictable-count]
evictable_count MUST return count - protected_count using saturating
subtraction. The result MUST be <= count.

## Set-Associative Lookup

r[set-assoc.decomposition]
Decomposing an address into tag, index, and offset MUST preserve all
information needed to reconstruct the original address. For any valid
`offset_bits` and `index_bits` with `offset_bits + index_bits <= 64`,
`reconstruct_address(decompose_address(addr))` MUST equal `addr`.

r[set-assoc.component-bounds]
extract_offset MUST return a value that fits in `offset_bits` bits.
extract_index MUST return a value that fits in `index_bits` bits.
extract_tag MUST return a value that fits in the remaining
`64 - offset_bits - index_bits` tag bits.

r[set-assoc.hit]
find_way(set, tag) MUST return `Some(i)` only when `set[i] == Some(tag)`.
lookup_set(set, addr, offset_bits, index_bits) MUST return the way whose
stored tag matches `extract_tag(addr, offset_bits, index_bits)`.

r[set-assoc.miss]
find_way(set, tag) MUST return `None` only when no way in the set holds
`Some(tag)`. lookup_set MUST miss when every way disagrees with the
requested tag.

r[set-assoc.no-duplicates]
Within a set, at most one way SHOULD hold a given non-empty tag.
check_no_duplicate_tags MUST return true if and only if no two distinct
ways hold the same `Some(tag)` value.

r[set-assoc.insert-preserves-uniqueness]
Inserting a tag into an empty way of a set that already has no duplicate
tags, when that tag is absent from all other ways, MUST preserve the
no-duplicate-tags invariant.

r[set-assoc.no-aliasing]
For two addresses with the same index but different tags, a hit for one
MUST NOT be a hit for the other's tag. The matched way MUST identify the
requested line, not another tag that shares the set.

r[set-assoc.set-isolation]
Changing a cache set whose index differs from the requested address's
index MUST NOT change the lookup result for that address. Different
indices MUST select different sets.

## False Sharing Detection

r[false-sharing.same-line]
same_cache_line MUST return true if and only if the two addresses are in
the same cache line. For power-of-two `line_size`, this is equivalent to
comparing the address bits above the offset.

r[false-sharing.distinct-line]
If two addresses are on different cache lines, they MUST NOT false-share.
For canonical tag/index decomposition, this means at least one of tag or
index differs.

r[false-sharing.alignment]
is_line_aligned MUST return true if and only if `addr % line_size == 0`.
line_start MUST clear the offset bits and return the first byte address of
the containing line.

r[false-sharing.padding]
padding_prevents_sharing(addr_a, size_a, addr_b, line_size) MUST return
true if and only if object B starts at least one full cache line after the
end of object A: `addr_b >= addr_a + size_a + line_size`. Under that
condition, no byte of A may share a cache line with any byte at or after
`addr_b`.

r[false-sharing.object-span]
cache_lines_spanned MUST return the number of cache lines touched by a
positive-size object, equal to `ceil((addr % line_size + size) /
line_size)`. For this computation, `(addr % line_size) + size` MUST fit
in `u64`.

r[false-sharing.decomposition-equivalence]
For `offset_bits < 64` and `offset_bits + index_bits <= 64`,
same_cache_line(a, b, 1 << offset_bits) MUST be equivalent to
`extract_tag(a, offset_bits, index_bits) == extract_tag(b, offset_bits,
index_bits)` and `extract_index(a, offset_bits, index_bits) ==
extract_index(b, offset_bits, index_bits)`.

## Write Policy

r[write-policy.write-back-dirty]
Under write-back policy, a store MUST set the dirty bit and a freshly
loaded line MUST be clean.

r[write-policy.write-back-eviction]
Evicting a dirty line MUST write its data to memory at the selected
address. Evicting a clean line MUST leave memory unchanged.

r[write-policy.write-through-clean]
Under write-through policy, stores and loads MUST leave the dirty bit
clear.

r[write-policy.write-through-memory]
A write-through store MUST update memory immediately at the selected
address, and the updated memory cell MUST equal the cache line's new data.

r[write-policy.policy-non-interference]
Updating one cache line in a mixed-policy cache MUST NOT change any other
line's state.

r[write-policy.flush-all]
When every clean line already matches memory, flush_all MUST clear every
line's dirty bit and leave memory matching every cache line's data.

r[write-policy.read-equivalence]
A read hit MUST return the cached data regardless of whether the line uses
write-back or write-through policy.

## MOESI Coherence

r[moesi.single-writer]
At most one cache MAY hold a line in a dirty-owner state (`Modified` or
`Owned`) at a time.

r[moesi.owned-entry]
A remote read against a `Modified` owner MUST move that owner to
`Owned` while the requester receives a shared copy.

r[moesi.owned-supply]
When any cache holds a line in `Owned`, reads MUST source dirty data from
some cache rather than from memory.

r[moesi.writeback]
Evicting an `Owned` line MUST write back to memory before the owner is
lost. Evicting a `Shared` line MUST NOT require a writeback.

r[moesi.transitions]
Every valid processor event and snoop bus action MUST produce a valid
next state and a valid bus action/result.

r[moesi.mesi-refinement]
For transitions that stay within the `M/E/S/I` subset, MOESI MUST agree
with the existing MESI transition model after mapping `Owned -> Shared`.

r[moesi.no-stale-reads]
Under the memory-consistency relation `memory_up_to_date <==>
!dirty_owner_exists`, reads MUST use memory only when memory is current;
otherwise some cache MUST be the read source.

## Cache Hierarchy

Cache hierarchy levels are modeled as canonical finite sets of line tags.
Exec code may represent a level as a deduplicated sequence, but the
requirements below are about line presence and absence.

r[hierarchy.inclusive-invariant]
Under the inclusive policy, every line present in L1 MUST also be present
in L2 after every modeled operation.

r[hierarchy.back-invalidation]
Under the inclusive policy, evicting a line from L2 MUST also invalidate
that line from L1 so the inclusive invariant is preserved.

r[hierarchy.exclusive-invariant]
Under the exclusive policy, no line may be present in both L1 and L2 at
the same time.

r[hierarchy.exclusive-swap]
Under the exclusive policy, promoting a line from L2 to L1 MUST remove it
from L2 in the same abstract step.

r[hierarchy.non-inclusive]
Under the non-inclusive policy, the hierarchy MUST impose no subset or
disjointness constraint between L1 and L2.

r[hierarchy.capacity]
For canonical levels, the inclusive effective capacity MUST equal |L2|,
and the exclusive effective capacity MUST equal |L1| + |L2|.

r[hierarchy.snoop-scope]
Under the inclusive policy, an L2 miss MUST imply an L1 miss for the same
line. Under the exclusive policy, checking L2 alone MUST NOT be assumed
sufficient.

## Store Buffer Forwarding

r[store-buffer.youngest-match]
When more than one buffered store can satisfy a load, forwarding MUST
select the youngest matching store.

r[store-buffer.full-coverage]
A load MUST forward from a buffered store only when that store fully
covers the load byte range.

r[store-buffer.cache-fallback]
When no buffered store matches a load, the load MUST use the cache path
instead of forwarding.

r[store-buffer.drain-ordering]
Buffered stores MUST drain in FIFO order: the oldest store commits first,
and draining one store MUST preserve the relative order of the remaining
stores.

r[store-buffer.fence]
A store fence MUST leave the buffer empty before any post-fence store is
enqueued.

r[store-buffer.capacity]
When the store buffer is full, enqueue MUST reject the new store rather
than silently dropping it. When the buffer is not full, enqueue MUST grow
the buffer by exactly one entry.

## Cache Prefetch

r[cache-prefetch.no-fault]
Prefetching an invalid or inaccessible address MUST be a no-op for the
modeled cache state and MUST NOT modify architectural state.

r[cache-prefetch.invisible]
Prefetch operations MUST leave registers, memory contents, and the program
counter unchanged. Prefetch only affects modeled cache state.

r[cache-prefetch.cache-effect]
A valid prefetch-for-read MUST leave the requester in a valid MESI state
matching a demand read miss, and a valid prefetch-for-write MUST leave the
requester in Exclusive while invalidating other modeled holders.

r[cache-prefetch.coherence]
A valid prefetch-for-read MUST issue BusRead and a valid prefetch-for-write
MUST issue BusReadX. Invalid-address prefetches MUST issue no bus action.

r[cache-prefetch.drop-safe]
Dropping a modeled prefetch step MUST leave both architectural state and
cache state unchanged.

r[cache-prefetch.eviction-safe]
Replacing a prefetched line MUST write back a dirty victim to memory before
installation. Replacing a clean victim MUST leave memory unchanged.

## Directory Coherence

r[directory.consistency]
The directory's owner and sharer bit-vector MUST agree with the actual MESI
state held by each modeled cache at all times.

r[directory.invalidation]
Granting a write request MUST emit targeted invalidations to every other cache
that currently holds the line, and the post-ack state MUST leave those caches
invalid.

r[directory.single-writer]
A completed write grant MUST leave exactly one modeled cache with the line in
Modified and every other cache Invalid.

r[directory.eviction-notify]
Evicting a tracked line MUST clear the corresponding owner or sharer record. A
Modified owner eviction MUST request writeback before the line becomes uncached.

r[directory.serialization]
Same-line write requests MUST be serialized by applying them one at a time in a
total order. Requests to different lines MUST remain independent.

r[directory.mesi-embedding]
The directory-implied per-cache state MUST always be a valid MESI state, and a
consistent exclusive owner MUST hold the line in either Exclusive or Modified.

## Hash Bucket

r[hash-bucket.assign]
assign_bucket MUST return hash % num_buckets. The result MUST be less
than num_buckets. num_buckets MUST be nonzero.

r[hash-bucket.assign-pow2]

and num_buckets & (num_buckets - 1) == 0.

## Log

r[log.agree-at]
agree_at(a, b, i) MUST return true if and only if both logs have an entry
at index i and the entries have the same term. Agreement checks term
equality, not value equality.

r[log.prefix-matching]
If two logs agree at every index in [0, k), they MUST have matching terms
at all those indices. logs_match_prefix(a, b, k) MUST hold when
agree_at(a, b, i) holds for all 0 <= i < k.

r[log.append]
Appending an entry MUST increase the log length by 1. The appended entry
MUST appear at the new last index. All prior entries MUST be unchanged.

r[log.truncate]
Truncating a log to length k MUST discard all entries at index k and
beyond. The first k entries MUST be unchanged. The resulting length MUST
be k. k MUST not exceed the current length.

## Partition

r[partition.is-valid]
is_valid_partition MUST check that a sequence of intervals forms a valid
non-overlapping gap-free covering: every interval is non-empty (lo < hi),
intervals are sorted by start, and each interval's end equals the next
interval's start. An empty sequence MUST be a valid partition.

r[partition.is-non-empty-interval]
is_non_empty_interval MUST return true if and only if lo < hi.

r[partition.is-adjacent-pair]
is_adjacent_pair MUST return true if and only if a_hi == b_lo. Adjacent
intervals form a continuous covering with no gap or overlap.

r[partition.covers]
partition_covers MUST verify that a non-empty partition exactly covers
a specified range [lo, hi): the first interval starts at lo and the
last interval ends at hi.

r[partition.span]
partition_span_lo MUST return the first interval's start.
partition_span_hi MUST return the last interval's end. Both MUST
require a non-empty partition.

## Pressure

r[pressure.classify]
classify_level MUST return 0 (Normal) when value < warn_threshold,
1 (Warning) when warn_threshold <= value < crit_threshold, and
2 (Critical) when value >= crit_threshold. The result MUST always be
0, 1, or 2. Classification MUST be monotonic: higher values produce
same or higher levels. warn_threshold MUST be <= crit_threshold.

r[pressure.is-critical]
is_critical MUST return true if and only if level == 2.

r[pressure.should-pause]
should_pause MUST return true if and only if level >= 2. Critical

be commutative, associative, and idempotent. The result MUST be >= both
inputs.

r[pressure.is-all-normal]

slice equals 0. An empty slice MUST return true.

## Rate Limit

capped at burst. On multiplication overflow, MUST return burst. Zero
elapsed time MUST return tokens unchanged. The result MUST never exceed
burst. Refill MUST be monotonic in elapsed_ms.

r[rate-limit.try-consume]

is_within_burst MUST return true if and only if tokens <= burst. After
any refill, tokens MUST be within burst.

r[rate-limit.wait-time]
tokens_to_wait_ms MUST return 0 when tokens >= cost, and
ceil((cost - tokens) * 1000 / rate_per_sec) otherwise. rate_per_sec
MUST be nonzero.

## Sequential

r[sequential.is-sequential]
is_sequential MUST return true if and only if offset == last_offset +
last_size, handling u64 overflow by returning false when the addition
would wrap. offset 0 with last_offset 0 and last_size 0 MUST be
sequential.

r[sequential.update-consecutive]
update_consecutive MUST return consecutive + 1 (saturating at u64::MAX)
when is_seq is true, and 0 when is_seq is false. Non-sequential access
MUST reset the counter.

r[sequential.should-prefetch]
should_prefetch MUST return true if and only if consecutive >= threshold.
threshold MUST be nonzero. MUST return false when consecutive < threshold.

r[sequential.prefetch-size]
prefetch_size MUST return min(consecutive * chunk_size, max_prefetch),
saturating on multiplication overflow. chunk_size MUST be nonzero. The
result MUST never exceed max_prefetch.

## Cross-Module Properties (New Modules)

r[properties.chunk-ceil-is-div-ceil]
chunk_count_ceil(n, k) MUST equal div_ceil(n, k) for all n, k > 0.
The two independent ceiling division implementations MUST agree.

r[properties.bounded-range-specializes-interval]
When has_upper is true, bounded_range.contains(lo, hi, true, x) MUST
equal interval.contains(lo, hi, x). The generic range MUST reduce to
the numeric interval when bounded.

r[properties.partition-no-overlap]
For adjacent intervals in a valid partition, interval.overlaps MUST
return false. Partition adjacency (a_hi == b_lo) MUST guarantee
interval non-overlap.

MUST report deterministic first-failure metadata before higher-level transition
predicates rely on those references.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.node-state]
Raft node-state envelope primitives MUST admit only follower, candidate, or
leader roles inside the finite model. Leader role metadata MUST belong to the
node current term, candidate role metadata MUST record a self-vote in that term,
and applied/commit/log indexes MUST remain ordered.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.applied-prefix]
Raft applied-prefix primitives MUST admit only monotone contiguous application
steps. Non-empty steps MUST start at the next unapplied index, the new
last-applied index MUST be committed and present in the local log, and no-op
steps MUST carry no first-applied index.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.client-proposal]
Raft client-proposal primitives MUST admit finite command identifiers only when
the target node is model-valid and admitted as leader for the exact proposal
term. Proposals to followers, stale terms, future terms, unknown commands, or
out-of-model nodes MUST reject with deterministic metadata and MUST NOT claim
client retry, end-to-end linearizability, or application execution behavior.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.term]

observing any term-bearing input. Observing a lower or equal term MUST keep the
current term unchanged; observing a higher term MUST advance to that term.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.message]
Raft message primitives MUST define finite term-bearing envelopes for the modeled
Raft input classes and reject invalid envelope kinds or node-universe bounds.
Stale-message predicates MUST classify a term-bearing message as stale if and

classification and envelope admission MUST NOT require network delivery, timing,
or transport claims.

contiguous index MUST preserve the no-gap predicate.

storage durability behavior.

performance, or application side effects.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.append-entries]
Raft AppendEntries admission primitives MUST compose stale-term rejection with
the previous-log index/term consistency check. A stale leader term or a previous
log mismatch MUST reject the request. Conflict metadata MUST be bounded by the
finite follower-log length, and admitted follower log-update predicates MUST
preserve the retained previous-log prefix before appending finite entries
without claiming network delivery, storage durability, or follower mutation
semantics beyond this finite admission/update slice.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.log-matching]
Raft log-matching primitives MUST show that agreement at a one-based log index

log-update predicates admitted at a previous-log index MUST preserve that
matching prefix before any appended entries.

Raft follower log-update primitives MUST model rejected AppendEntries updates as
no-mutation outcomes and accepted updates as finite retained-prefix plus

index inside the finite follower log and MUST report a successor length equal to
the retained prefix plus admitted entry count without claiming storage durability,
network delivery, or production follower mutation semantics beyond this finite
update slice.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.commit]
Raft commit-index primitives MUST admit a candidate commit index only when a

finite committed entry at the modeled position is still present with the same
index, term, and command identifier. A later leader missing that committed entry
MUST be rejected by the finite predicate.

without claiming transfer, disk durability, or application snapshot correctness.

metadata. Stale or boundary-mismatched snapshots MUST be rejected by the finite
predicate.

Raft membership primitives MUST model finite configuration epochs, old/new voter
cardinalities, and joint-consensus quorum metadata bounded to a modeled node
universe. Membership epoch admission MUST reject regressions, non-joint

consensus quorum admission MUST require both old-configuration and
new-configuration majorities without claiming dynamic reconfiguration liveness,
service discovery, persistence, or rollout behavior.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.trace]
Raft transition-trace primitives MUST model finite adjacent steps whose input is
a valid finite Raft message envelope. Non-stale admitted steps MUST advance the
receiver term according to the monotone observed-term rule, while stale rejected

admission MUST NOT claim network ordering, delivery, fairness, storage,
availability, or runtime scheduling behavior.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.invariant-bundle]
Raft invariant-bundle primitives MUST compose finite local model validity from
term/persistent metadata consistency, volatile applied/commit/log bounds,
contiguous no-gap indexed logs, coherent snapshot metadata, and bounded
membership metadata. Invariant-preservation admission MUST expose a valid
post-transition bundle, no-mutation admissions MUST preserve the bundle
unchanged, and focused proof lemmas MUST show preservation for modeled
observed-term, commit-advance, membership-epoch, InstallSnapshot, and
transition-trace slices without claiming runtime networking, storage durability,
timing, liveness, availability, or production implementation correctness.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.admission]
Raft deterministic-admission primitives MUST combine finite before-invariant,
message-envelope, transition-trace, and after-invariant checks in a stable order.
Admission results MUST expose a finite success/failure code, accepted candidates

failing modeled finite check without claiming runtime network, clock, storage,
availability, or production implementation behavior.

OpenRaft-inspired log-pointer primitives MUST model finite pointer ordering for
purged, snapshot, applied, committed, flushed, submitted, and accepted indexes.
The pointer lattice MUST reject regressions where applied exceeds committed,
committed exceeds submitted, flushed exceeds submitted, or submitted exceeds
accepted. Admission metadata MUST return OK exactly for the valid pointer
predicate and otherwise report the first pointer-order violation in stable
lattice order, without claiming disk durability or storage implementation
behavior.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.openraft-io-progress]
OpenRaft-inspired I/O progress primitives MUST model finite flushed, submitted,
and accepted cursors. Progress metadata MUST satisfy flushed <= submitted <=
accepted, and admitted progress updates MUST move every cursor monotonically.
Admission metadata MUST return OK exactly for the valid monotone-update predicate
and otherwise report invalid old metadata, invalid new metadata, or the first
regressing cursor without claiming fsync, crash recovery, or storage durability.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.openraft-vote-log-io]
OpenRaft-inspired vote/log I/O ordering primitives MUST admit a finite log write
only when term/vote metadata for that log term has already been ordered first.

predicates MUST NOT claim fsync, crash recovery, or storage durability.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.openraft-effective-membership]
OpenRaft-inspired effective-membership primitives MUST model a committed epoch
and an effective epoch where committed <= effective. A conflicting uncommitted
effective membership rollback MUST restore the effective epoch to the committed
epoch. Admission metadata MUST return OK exactly for ordered committed/effective
metadata and MUST report older-effective metadata deterministically without
claiming runtime joint-consensus reconfiguration behavior.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.openraft-replication-session]
OpenRaft-inspired replication-session primitives MUST isolate finite replication
progress by leader term, leader node, and governing membership log index. Stale
session updates, backwards matched-index movement, and matched indexes beyond the
leader log MUST be rejected. Admission metadata MUST return OK exactly for the
current-session bounded-update predicate and otherwise reject stale sessions
before matched-index movement or leader-log-bound checks.

r[domain-primitives.raft-consensus.openraft-read-linearizer]
OpenRaft-inspired read-linearizer primitives MUST model only finite readiness:
a read is ready exactly when local last-applied index has caught up to the read
log index. Admission metadata MUST return OK exactly for the local-apply catch-up
predicate. These predicates MUST NOT claim quorum RPC behavior, lease timing,
clock drift bounds, network delivery, or end-to-end application linearizability.

A cut is consistent if for any event in the cut, all causally preceding events are also in the cut. Uses vector clock happens-before relation.

r[causal-order.cut-join]
Cut join MUST return the component-wise maximum (vector clock merge) of two cuts. The result preserves consistency if both inputs are consistent cuts.

## Cost Tracker

r[cost-tracker.cost-non-negative]
compute_cost MUST return a non-negative value for any inputs. Zero tokens or zero price MUST yield zero cost.

r[cost-tracker.cost-monotonic]
Accumulating a turn cost MUST produce a total >= the previous total (monotonically non-decreasing).

r[cost-tracker.cost-additive]
Accumulating a turn cost MUST produce exactly total_before + turn_cost. Two accumulations MUST compose associatively.

r[cost-tracker.threshold-fires-once]
A threshold crossing MUST fire when prev < limit AND current >= limit. It MUST NOT fire when already crossed (prev >= limit) or not yet reached (current < limit). Over a monotonic sequence, at most one adjacent pair crosses any given threshold.

r[cost-tracker.milestone-count]
Milestone count MUST equal floor(current/interval) - floor(prev/interval). Count MUST be zero when both values fall in the same interval. Milestones MUST compose additively: count(a,c) == count(a,b) + count(b,c).

r[cost-tracker.milestone-non-negative]
Milestone count MUST be non-negative when current >= prev and interval > 0.

r[cost-tracker.budget-status-exhaustive]
Budget status MUST map every (soft, hard, total) triple to exactly one of NoBudget, Ok, Warning, or Exceeded. No limits means NoBudget. Under all defined limits means Ok. Between soft and hard means Warning. At or above hard means Exceeded.

r[cost-tracker.budget-status-monotone]
Budget status MUST be monotone: increasing total never moves status backward. Warning is stable (stays Warning or advances to Exceeded). Exceeded is absorbing.

r[cost-tracker.hard-budget-overrides-hint]
Model selection MUST return smol (cheapest) when cost >= hard_limit, regardless of user hint or complexity score.

r[cost-tracker.hint-overrides-score]
When under hard limit, a user hint MUST override the complexity score in model selection.

r[cost-tracker.score-thresholds-partition]
Score thresholds MUST partition the score range into smol (< low), default ([low, high]), and slow (> high) with no gaps.

r[cost-tracker.soft-budget-demotes]
Soft budget pressure (score/2) MUST never promote — adjusted score <= original score. The resulting role MUST be <= the role without soft pressure.

r[cost-tracker.score-non-negative]
Complexity score MUST be non-negative when all weights are non-negative (u64 inputs guarantee this).

## Cross-module: Cost Tracker

r[properties.accumulate-is-advance]
Cost accumulation is a monotonic advance: total_after >= total_before.

r[properties.threshold-crossing-irreversible]
Once a threshold is crossed in a monotonic sequence, it stays crossed — no later adjacent pair can cross the same threshold.

r[properties.budget-warning-implies-not-ok]
Warning status implies we are past Ok — the two states are mutually exclusive.

r[properties.budget-exceeded-stays-exceeded]
Exceeded is absorbing under increasing totals — once exceeded, always exceeded.

## Environment Scrubbing

r[env-scrub.suffix-case-insensitive]
Secret suffix detection MUST be case-insensitive. ASCII uppercasing MUST be idempotent and length-preserving.

r[env-scrub.blocked-keys-absent]
Every key in the explicit blocklist MUST be identified as secret. Byte sequence equality MUST be used for exact matching.

r[env-scrub.suffix-matched-absent]
Every key whose uppercased form ends with a secret suffix (_SECRET, _TOKEN, _PASSWORD, _CREDENTIALS, _API_KEY, _APIKEY, _PRIVATE_KEY) MUST be identified as secret.

r[env-scrub.sandbox-marker-present]
The sandbox marker key (CLANKERS_SANDBOX) MUST NOT be blocked and MUST NOT match any secret suffix. It is not a secret.

r[env-scrub.output-size-bounded]
The filter count MUST be bounded by the input size. Filtering can only remove entries, never add them.

r[env-scrub.filter-idempotent]
Re-filtering already-filtered keys MUST keep all of them. If every key in the list is non-secret, the count equals the list length.

r[env-scrub.blocklist-disjoint-safe]
Common safe variable names (PATH, HOME) MUST NOT be in the blocklist and MUST NOT match any secret suffix.

r[env-scrub.empty-yields-marker]
Filtering an empty key list MUST yield zero safe entries.

## Cross-module: Environment Scrubbing

r[properties.to-upper-preserves-suffix]
If a key ends with an uppercase suffix, uppercasing the key preserves the suffix — uppercase suffixes are fixed points of to_upper.

r[properties.secret-implies-not-safe]
A secret key is never safe — is_secret and !is_secret are mutually exclusive.

## Scope Coverage

r[scope.coverage-reflexive]
A scope MUST cover itself. Coverage is defined as starts-with on byte sequences: covers(scope, target) iff target starts with scope.

r[scope.coverage-transitive]
If scope A covers B and B covers C, then A MUST cover C. Prefix containment is transitive.

r[scope.coverage-rejects-non-prefix]
A scope MUST NOT cover a target that does not start with the scope prefix.

r[scope.coverage-narrowing-monotone]
If parent scope covers child scope, then everything the child covers is also covered by the parent. Narrowing is monotone.

r[scope.compound-requires-all-fields]
Compound scoping (mount + prefix) MUST require all fields to match. Mount mismatch MUST deny regardless of prefix match.

r[scope.optional-none-unconstrained]
An optional scope constraint of None MUST allow any target. None is unconstrained.

r[access-mode.order-reflexive]
Every mode MUST be ≤ itself. The ordering is reflexive.

r[access-mode.order-transitive]
The mode ordering MUST be transitive. READ, WRITE, DELETE are each ≤ FULL but pairwise incomparable.

r[access-mode.order-antisymmetric]
The mode ordering MUST be antisymmetric. If a ≤ b and b ≤ a then a == b.

r[access-mode.permits-ordering]
mode_permits(cap, op) MUST return true iff the operation mode is ≤ the capability mode. Read-only MUST deny write and delete. Full MUST allow all.

r[pattern.wildcard-contains-any]
A wildcard pattern MUST contain any other pattern.

r[pattern.non-wildcard-cannot-contain-wildcard]
A non-wildcard pattern that does not contain the sentinel MUST NOT contain the wildcard pattern.

r[pattern.containment-reflexive]
Every pattern MUST contain itself.

r[pattern.containment-transitive]
Pattern containment MUST be transitive for well-formed patterns (non-wildcard patterns must not contain the sentinel value).

## Glob Matching

r[glob.wildcard-matches-all]
A glob pattern of exactly `"*"` MUST match any input.

r[glob.exact-match]
A glob pattern with no `*` MUST match only exact byte equality and reject different inputs.

r[glob.prefix-match]
A glob pattern with trailing `*` MUST match inputs starting with the prefix before the `*`.

r[glob.multi-segment-match]
A glob pattern with multiple `*` wildcards MUST match inputs where segments appear in order: first anchored at start, last at end, middle anywhere.

r[glob.non-match-rejected]
A glob pattern MUST reject inputs that don't satisfy the pattern structure.

## Variant Subsumption

r[subsumption.identity]
Every variant MUST subsume itself. Subsumption is reflexive and forms a partial order (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive).

r[subsumption.acyclic]
Subsumption MUST be acyclic. If a subsumes b and b subsumes a, then a == b. Subsumption MUST be transitive.

r[subsumption.admin-full]
Full MUST subsume Read, Write, Delete, and Watch. These are the admin-to-leaf edges in the subsumption DAG.

r[subsumption.soundness]
If variant a does not subsume variant b, then no capability of type a can authorize operations of type b. Leaf variants MUST NOT subsume Full. Independent variants (Prompt, ToolUse, Delegate) MUST NOT subsume each other.

## Authorization Composition

r[authorize.decomposition]
authorizes(cap, op) MUST equal subsumes(cap.variant, op.variant) && covers(cap.scope, op.target) && mode_permits(cap.mode, op.mode). Each factor is independently verified.

r[authorize.rejects-scope-failure]
Scope mismatch MUST deny even with matching variant and mode.

r[authorize.rejects-mode-failure]
Mode mismatch MUST deny even with matching variant and scope.

r[authorize.rejects-variant-failure]
Variant mismatch MUST deny even with matching scope and mode.

r[authorize.all-match]
When all three factors match, authorization MUST succeed.

r[authorize.compound-scope]
Authorization with compound scope MUST require mount equality and prefix coverage. Mount mismatch MUST deny.

r[authorize.optional-constraint]
Authorization with optional constraint: None cap constraint MUST NOT block. Some cap with None target MUST block.

## Delegation Containment

r[containment.decomposition]
contains(parent, child) MUST equal subsumes(parent.variant, child.variant) && covers(parent.scope, child.scope) && mode_le(child.mode, parent.mode).

r[containment.no-scope-widening]
If the parent scope does not cover the child scope, containment MUST fail.

r[containment.no-mode-escalation]
If the child mode is not ≤ the parent mode, containment MUST fail.

r[containment.no-variant-escalation]

r[containment.self-contained]
Every capability MUST contain itself.

r[containment.optional-constraint]
Optional containment: parent None MUST contain any child. Parent Some MUST block child None.

## Delegation Chain

r[delegation.depth-bounded]
Chain depth MUST NOT exceed MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH (8). Depths 0-8 are valid, 9+ are invalid.

r[delegation.root-depth-zero]
Root tokens MUST have depth 0.

r[delegation.depth-increments]
Each delegation level MUST increment depth by exactly 1.

r[delegation.delegate-gate]
Delegation MUST require the parent to hold the Delegate capability. Without Delegate, delegation is denied.

r[delegation.chain-attenuation]
Each parent-to-child transition MUST attenuate: parent variant subsumes child, child mode <= parent mode. Escalation on either axis MUST be rejected.

r[delegation.chain-valid]
A full chain is valid iff: non-empty, root at depth 0, last depth within bounds, and every consecutive pair passes level validation.

## Token Timestamps

r[token-timestamp.expiration-tolerance]
A token is expired when now > expires_at + tolerance. Saturating addition MUST prevent overflow. Within the tolerance window, the token MUST NOT be expired. Zero tolerance means expired iff now > expires_at.

r[token-timestamp.fresh-token-valid]
A token checked at its issued_at time with issued_at <= expires_at MUST NOT be expired.

r[token-timestamp.expiration-monotonic]
Once a token is expired, it MUST stay expired as time advances.

r[token-timestamp.future-rejection]
A token with issued_at > now + tolerance MUST be rejected as from the future. Clock skew within tolerance MUST be accepted.

r[token-timestamp.refresh-threshold]
A token needs refresh when remaining lifetime <= 20% of total lifetime. Expired tokens always need refresh. Fresh tokens (at issued_at) MUST NOT need refresh.

r[token-timestamp.token-valid]
A token is temporally valid iff not expired and not from the future. A well-formed token checked at its issued_at time MUST be valid.

## Cross-module: UCAN Authorization

r[properties.delegation-safety]
If a parent contains a capability and that capability authorizes an operation, then the parent also authorizes the operation. Delegation cannot create new access.

r[properties.auth-implies-subsumes]
Authorization implies all three factors hold: variant subsumption, scope coverage, and mode permission.

r[properties.containment-implies-factors]
Containment implies all three factors hold: variant subsumption, scope coverage, and mode ordering.

r[properties.token-valid-at-issue]
A well-formed token is temporally valid at its issued_at time.

r[properties.chain-valid-implies-depth-bounded]
A valid delegation chain has depth within MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH (8). Chains exceeding the bound are rejected.

## Region Arithmetic

r[region.contains-addr]
A region (base, size) MUST contain address x iff base <= x < base + size.
Empty regions (size == 0) MUST contain no address. Overflow: base + size
MUST NOT exceed u64::MAX + 1 (enforced via requires).

r[region.end-addr]
The exclusive end address of a region MUST equal base + size.

r[region.is-empty]
A region is empty iff its size is zero.

r[region.disjoint]
Two regions MUST be disjoint iff they share no address. Disjointness

r[region.contains-region]
Region A contains region B iff every address in B is also in A.
Containment MUST be reflexive and transitive.

r[region.adjacent]
Two regions MUST be adjacent iff one ends exactly where the other
begins, with no gap and no overlap. Adjacency MUST be symmetric.

r[region.merge]
Merging two adjacent regions MUST produce a region covering exactly
the combined span. Split-then-merge MUST be a roundtrip.

r[region.split]
Splitting a region at an offset within (0, size) MUST produce two
non-empty, non-overlapping, adjacent sub-regions whose sizes sum
to the original size.

## Cross-module: Region ↔ Interval

r[properties.region-contains-agrees-interval]
region_contains_addr(base, size, x) MUST agree with interval::contains(base, base+size, x)
for valid (non-overflowing) regions.

r[properties.region-disjoint-agrees-interval]
regions_disjoint(a_base, a_size, b_base, b_size) MUST agree with
!interval::overlaps(a_base, a_end, b_base, b_end) for valid regions.

r[properties.region-adjacent-agrees-interval]
region_adjacent(a_base, a_size, b_base, b_size) MUST agree with
interval::adjacent(a_base, a_end, b_base, b_end) for valid regions.

## Slab Allocation

r[slab.slot-index]
slot_index MUST return (addr - base) / slot_size for addresses within the slab region.
The slot index MUST be bounded: slot_index < slab_capacity.

r[slab.slot-offset]
slot_offset MUST return (addr - base) % slot_size, the byte position within a slot.

r[slab.slot-address]
slot_address MUST return base + index * slot_size. On aligned addresses,
slot_address(slot_index(addr)) MUST equal addr (roundtrip).

r[slab.is-slot-aligned]
An address is slot-aligned iff its slot_offset is zero.

r[slab.slab-capacity]
slab_capacity MUST return region_size / slot_size — the number of whole
slots that fit. Zero slot_size or region_size MUST yield zero.

r[slab.generation-valid]
A generation is valid if it is less than a maximum generation limit.
generation_increment MUST produce a valid successor. Validity MUST be
monotonic: if gen is invalid, gen+1 is also invalid.

r[slab.handle-pack]
handle_pack MUST combine an index and generation into a single u64.
handle_unpack_index and handle_unpack_generation MUST recover the
original values (roundtrip).

## Cross-module: Slab ↔ Page

r[properties.slab-slot-is-page-frame]
slot_index(addr, base, slot_size) with base=0 MUST agree with
page::frame_number(addr, slot_size).

r[properties.slab-capacity-is-pages-dual]
For exact multiples: slab_capacity(n * s, s) == n, matching the
inverse relationship with pages_needed.

## Buddy System

r[buddy.block-size]
block_size(order) MUST return 2^order. block_size(0) == 1.

r[buddy.buddy-of]
buddy_of(addr, order) MUST return the buddy address by flipping bit `order`
in addr. buddy_of MUST be an involution: buddy_of(buddy_of(addr, order), order) == addr.

r[buddy.order-for-size]
order_for_size(size) MUST return the minimum order k such that 2^k >= size.
For exact powers of two, order_for_size(2^k) == k.

r[buddy.can-coalesce]
Two blocks can coalesce iff they are buddies at the same order and both
are aligned to that order. Coalescing produces a block at order+1.

r[buddy.parent-block]
parent_block(addr, order) MUST return the start of the parent block at
order+1. The parent is aligned to order+1.

r[buddy.is-aligned-to-order]
An address is aligned to order iff addr % 2^order == 0.

## Cross-module: Buddy ↔ Bitwise/Integer

r[properties.buddy-uses-toggle]
buddy_of(addr, order) MUST equal bitwise::toggle_bit(addr, order).

r[properties.block-size-is-pow2]
block_size(order) MUST equal integer::pow2_spec(order).

## Watermark Allocation

r[watermark.remaining]
watermark_remaining(mark, base, capacity) MUST return capacity - (mark - base).
When mark == base, remaining MUST equal capacity.

r[watermark.fits]
watermark_fits(mark, size, base, capacity) MUST return true iff an allocation
of `size` bytes fits in the remaining space.

r[watermark.alloc]
watermark_alloc(mark, size) MUST return the new mark after allocating `size` bytes
(mark + size). The allocation occupies [mark, mark + size).

r[watermark.reset]
watermark_reset returns the base address. After reset, remaining == capacity.

r[watermark.is-empty]
The watermark is empty (no allocations) when mark == base.

r[watermark.monotonic]
Allocation only moves the mark forward: new_mark >= old_mark.

r[watermark.non-overlap]
Two successive allocations from the same watermark return disjoint regions.

r[watermark.capacity-conservation]
remaining + used == capacity, where used = mark - base.

## Cross-module: Watermark

r[properties.watermark-advance-is-monotonic]
watermark_alloc advances the mark, which satisfies monotonic::is_advance.

r[properties.watermark-alloc-disjoint-regions]
Two allocations from sequential marks produce regions that are
region::regions_disjoint.

## Eviction Score

r[eviction-score.weighted-score]
weighted_score MUST compute the weighted sum of four factor scores
using integer weights that sum to 100. Each factor score MUST be in
the range [0, 100]. The result MUST equal
w1*s1 + w2*s2 + w3*s3 + w4*s4.

r[eviction-score.full-score]
full_score MUST multiply the weighted base score by a priority
multiplier and a tier multiplier. Lower scores are evicted first.

r[eviction-score.weights-valid]
Eviction weights are valid when all four are in [0, 100] and their
sum equals 100.

r[eviction-score.priority-multiplier]
priority_multiplier MUST return 1 for Low (0), 2 for Normal (1),
4 for High (2), 20 for Critical (3). Higher priority entries get
higher scores (harder to evict).

r[eviction-score.tier-multiplier]
tier_multiplier MUST return 1 for Cold (0), 2 for Warm (1),
4 for Hot (2). Hotter entries get higher scores (harder to evict).

## Tier

r[tier.classify]
classify_tier MUST return Hot (2) if access_count >= hot_threshold,
Warm (1) if access_count >= warm_threshold, Cold (0) otherwise.
Thresholds MUST be ordered: warm_threshold <= hot_threshold.

r[tier.promote]
promote MUST return the next higher tier: Cold (0) becomes Warm (1),
Warm (1) becomes Hot (2), Hot (2) stays Hot (2).

r[tier.demote]
demote MUST return the next lower tier: Hot (2) becomes Warm (1),
Warm (1) becomes Cold (0), Cold (0) stays Cold (0).

r[tier.should-demote]
should_demote MUST return true when idle_time >= cold_idle_threshold
and current tier is above Cold.

## Markov

r[markov.confidence]
confidence_meets MUST return true when count * 100 >=
total * threshold_pct. This is the integer equivalent of
(count / total) >= (threshold_pct / 100).

r[markov.record-bounded]
After recording a transition, the count for that transition
MUST NOT exceed the total. The total MUST NOT exceed the
configured maximum.

r[markov.prediction-valid]
A prediction is valid when count > 0 and count <= total
and total > 0. The confidence ratio count/total MUST be
in (0, 1].

r[markov.best-prediction]
best_prediction MUST return the count of the most frequent
transition. If multiple transitions tie, any of them MAY be
returned.

## Type Lattice

r[type-lattice.can-convert]
can_convert MUST return true if and only if a value of the source
type can be converted to the target type. The conversion graph
MUST be reflexive: can_convert(t, t) for all valid types.

r[type-lattice.any-top]
ANY MUST act as the top element: can_convert(ANY, t) and
can_convert(t, ANY) MUST both return true for all valid types.

r[type-lattice.string-source]
STRING MUST be convertible to every other valid type.
can_convert(STRING, t) MUST return true for all valid t.

r[type-lattice.numeric-widening]
INTEGER MUST be convertible to FLOAT. FLOAT MUST be convertible
to INTEGER. Both MUST be convertible to STRING.

r[type-lattice.temporal-widening]
DATE MUST be convertible to DATETIME and vice versa. Both MUST
be convertible to STRING.

## Type Unification

r[unify.unifier-exists]
If some finite fuel budget makes the equation-list solver succeed, the
public `unify_spec` chooser MUST return a substitution. This requirement
covers witness selection, not semantic completeness of unification.

r[unify.unifier-correct]
Applying any substitution returned by the solver to both input types MUST
yield identical resulting types.

r[unify.occurs-check]
Unification MUST reject binding a variable to a type that already
contains that variable. The occurs check prevents infinite self-referential
types.

r[unify.subst-compose]
Substitution composition MUST model sequential application.
Applying compose(s2, s1) to a type MUST equal applying s1 first and s2
second. Composition MUST be associative.

r[unify.failure]
Obvious structural clashes MUST fail. In particular, distinct concrete
constructors MUST not unify, and an application MUST not unify with a
concrete constructor.

## De Bruijn Substitution

r[debruijn.well-scoped]
A de Bruijn term MUST be well scoped at depth d if and only if every
variable index appearing in the term is strictly smaller than d at the
point where it is interpreted. Entering an abstraction MUST increase the
available depth by one.

r[debruijn.shift-zero]
Shifting by zero MUST be the identity for every cutoff and term.

r[debruijn.shift-compose]
Shifting by m and then by n at the same cutoff MUST equal a single shift
by m + n at that cutoff.

r[debruijn.shift-preserves-scope]
If a term is well scoped at depth d and the shift cutoff is at most d,
then shifting by k MUST produce a term that is well scoped at depth
d + k.

r[debruijn.identity-substitution]
Lifting a term by one at cutoff c and then substituting the matching
variable c back in MUST recover the original term.

r[debruijn.subst-preserves-scope]
If a body is well scoped at depth d + 1 and the replacement term is well
scoped at depth d, then substituting the replacement for variable 0 MUST
produce a term that is well scoped at depth d.

r[debruijn.beta-scope]
Beta reduction of a well-scoped redex `App(Abs(body), arg)` MUST produce
an output term that is well scoped at the original outer depth. Non-redex
terms MUST not beta-reduce.

## Cross-Module Properties (Wave 1)

r[properties.signal-add-is-set-bit]
signal_add(set, sig) MUST equal bitwise::set_bit(set, sig) for all
set and sig < 64. The signal set-add operation is the same as setting
a bit.

r[properties.signal-remove-is-clear-bit]
signal_remove(set, sig) MUST equal bitwise::clear_bit(set, sig) for
all set and sig < 64. Signal removal is bit clearing.

r[properties.signal-contains-is-bit-at]
signal_contains(set, sig) MUST equal bitwise::bit_at(set, sig) for
all set and sig < 64. Signal membership test is bit inspection.

r[properties.permission-set-check-roundtrip]
has_permission(set_permission(mode, who, perm), who, perm) MUST be
true for all valid mode, who <= 2, perm <= 2. Setting a permission
then checking it always succeeds.

r[properties.permission-set-independence]
Setting permission (w1, p1) MUST NOT affect has_permission(mode, w2, p2)
when (w1, p1) != (w2, p2) and both are valid. Different permission
bits are independent.

r[properties.pages-needed-is-div-ceil]
pages_needed(size, ps) MUST equal div_ceil(size, ps) for all size
and ps > 0. Page count and ceiling division are the same computation.

r[properties.page-aligned-is-align-down-fixpoint]
is_page_aligned(addr, ps) MUST equal (align_down(addr, ps) == addr)
for ps > 0. An aligned address is a fixpoint of align_down.

r[properties.lease-valid-implies-not-expired]
For a non-revoked lease, is_valid(lease, now) MUST imply
!is_expired(lease.expiry, now). Lease validity is strictly stronger
than non-expiration.

r[properties.tier-score-monotonic]
If count_a <= count_b and warm_t <= hot_t, then
tier_multiplier(classify_tier(count_a, w, h)) MUST be <=
tier_multiplier(classify_tier(count_b, w, h)). Higher access count
never produces a lower tier multiplier.

r[properties.backoff-in-range]
compute_backoff(base, attempt, cap) MUST be <= cap for all inputs.
The backoff value is always bounded by the cap.

r[properties.approval-majority-implies-quorum]
If required >= majority(total) and is_merge_allowed(valid, required, true),
then is_quorum(valid, total). Meeting an approval threshold at least
as strong as majority guarantees a quorum.

r[properties.lease-renewal-is-advance]
For a non-revoked lease, effective_expiry(renew(lease, new_expiry))
>= effective_expiry(lease) when new_expiry > lease.expiry. Lease
renewal satisfies monotonic::is_advance on the effective expiry.

r[properties.two-phase-unanimity-implies-quorum]
If can_commit(votes) is true, then is_quorum(n, n) holds where
n = votes.len(). Unanimity (2PC requirement) implies any quorum
threshold.

r[properties.expires-at-monotonic-is-advance]
If ttl_a <= ttl_b, then is_advance(expires_at(now, ttl_a),
expires_at(now, ttl_b)). Longer TTL produces later (or equal)
expiration, satisfying monotonic advance.

r[properties.cow-clone-is-drain-start]
ref_count_after_clone(n) MUST equal after_start_op(n) for all n.
CoW cloning and drain start are the same increment-with-saturation.

r[properties.cow-drop-is-drain-finish]
ref_count_after_drop(n) MUST equal after_finish_op(n) for all n.
CoW drop and drain finish are the same decrement-with-floor.

## Cross-Module Properties (Wave 2)

r[properties.type-lattice-reflexive]
can_convert(t, t) MUST be true for all valid types. Type conversion
is reflexive — every type converts to itself.

r[properties.type-lattice-any-top]
can_convert(t, ANY) and can_convert(ANY, t) MUST both be true for
all valid types. ANY is the universal converter — top element in
both directions.

r[properties.circuit-breaker-preserves-validity]
next_state applied to a valid state MUST produce a valid state.
State transitions never leave the valid state space.

r[properties.process-terminal-blocks-circuit-open-blocks]
process_state::is_terminal(4) implies no outgoing transitions, and
circuit_breaker::allow_request(OPEN) is false. Both state machines
have a "blocked" state that prevents forward progress.

r[properties.bitmap-signal-agree]
For a single-word bitmap (num_bits <= 64), bitmap.get_spec(pos) MUST
equal signal_contains_spec(bitmap.words[0], pos). The bitmap's bit
decomposition agrees with signal's direct bit check.

r[properties.slab-slot-in-region]
slot_address(i, base, ss) MUST be contained in region (base, capacity)
when i < slab_capacity(capacity, ss) and slot_size > 0. Every valid
slab slot falls within the backing memory region.

r[properties.pressure-eviction-pipeline]

should_evict(count, capacity). Critical memory pressure triggers
the eviction decision.

r[properties.eviction-score-cold-minimum]

entries get the lowest protection score, making them first to evict.

## Cross-Module Properties (Wave 3)

r[properties.evictable-count-is-saturating-sub]
evictable_count(count, protected) MUST equal saturating_sub(count, protected).
Both compute max(a - b, 0) — the eviction module's counter agrees with
the arithmetic module's generic subtraction.

r[properties.gossip-infection-bounded]
infection_lower_bound(n, fanout, rounds) MUST be <= n for all inputs.
Gossip infection never exceeds the cluster size.

r[properties.gossip-infection-monotonic-rounds]
If rounds_a <= rounds_b, then infection_lower_bound(n, f, rounds_a)
<= infection_lower_bound(n, f, rounds_b). More rounds never reduce
the number of infected nodes.

r[properties.acid-empty-commit-identity]
commit(state, empty) MUST equal state for all states. Committing no
writes is a no-op.

r[properties.priority-multiplier-monotonic]

priority_multiplier(a) MUST be <= priority_multiplier(b).
Higher priority always produces a higher or equal multiplier.

With valid weights (sum 100, each <= 100), factor scores in [0, 100],
priority in [0, 3], and tier in [0, 2], full_score MUST be <= 800000.

r[layout-constraint.clamp]
clamp_to_constraint MUST produce a value satisfying the constraint.

None otherwise. Debit MUST be monotonic: the result is always <= balance
when defined. Debiting zero MUST be the identity function.

same total as before. Value MUST be neither created nor destroyed. Two
successive valid transfers MUST preserve the three-account total.

r[transfer.execute]

transfer is valid. The sender decreases by exactly amount; the receiver
increases by exactly amount. Transferring zero changes nothing.

Duplicate transfers MUST be rejected before any balance check. A
non-duplicate request MUST have a strictly higher id.

if transfer_valid and not duplicate.

## Double Entry

r[double-entry.sum]
sum_amounts MUST return the sum of all amounts in the sequence. The sum
MUST be non-negative. Sum of an empty sequence MUST be zero. Sum MUST
distribute over concatenation: sum(a ++ b) == sum(a) + sum(b). Appending
an element increases the sum by that element.

r[double-entry.balanced]
is_balanced MUST return true if and only if sum(debits) == sum(credits).
Balanced MUST be symmetric: is_balanced(d, c) == is_balanced(c, d).
Empty sequences MUST be balanced. Adding equal amounts to both sides
MUST preserve balance. Concatenating two balanced pairs MUST stay balanced.

r[double-entry.trial-balance]

MUST be zero if and only if the entry is balanced. Trial balance MUST
be additive across concatenated entries.

r[double-entry.all-positive]

sequence is greater than zero. Empty sequences MUST satisfy all_positive
vacuously.

and positive. A simple entry is always balanced.

## Journal

r[journal.apply-entry]
apply_entry MUST return prior_balance - amount for debits, prior_balance
+ amount for credits. Returns None on underflow (debit exceeds balance)
or overflow (credit exceeds u64::MAX). Credits increase balance; debits
decrease balance.

r[journal.entry-balance-correct]
A journal entry's running_balance MUST equal the result of applying its
operation to the prior balance. The running balance MUST be non-negative
and fit in u64.

r[journal.seq-nums-monotonic]
Sequence numbers in a valid journal MUST be strictly increasing.
Appending an entry with a higher sequence number MUST preserve
monotonicity.

r[journal.valid]

Appending a valid entry to a valid journal MUST produce a valid journal.
The prefix of the extended journal MUST equal the original journal.

r[properties.balance-has-funds-is-in-range]
has_funds_spec(b, a) MUST equal in_range_spec(a, 0, b). The sufficient-
funds predicate is a range check.

r[properties.transfer-uses-debit-credit]

receiver_after equals balance::credit_spec. Transfer composes balance
operations.

MUST only run after quiescence and MUST resynchronize both copies without
changing the active version.

r[left-right.snapshot-consistency]
A reader ticket obtained before a publish MUST continue to name the old
side's unchanged version after the publish. A live reader on the old side
MUST block catch-up until it exits, so readers never observe partial writer
updates.

## Surelock

r[surelock-lock-id.unique]
allocate_lock MUST allocate a fresh lock ID for each successful allocation.
Two successive successful allocations MUST never produce the same lock ID.

r[surelock-lock-id.monotonic]
Lock IDs MUST increase with creation order. Later successful allocations
MUST receive strictly greater IDs than earlier successful allocations.

r[surelock-lock-id.stable-identity]
A lock's ID MUST stay attached to the lock record itself. Reordering lock
records in a collection MUST NOT change any lock ID.

r[surelock-level-order.total-order]
Level comparison MUST be a strict total order: for any two levels exactly
one of less-than, equality, or greater-than holds.

r[surelock-level-order.lock-after]
lock_after MUST admit acquisitions exactly when current <= next in level
order. Equal-level reacquisition checks and upward acquisitions are allowed;
descending acquisitions are rejected.

r[surelock-level-order.derived-higher]
new_higher_from(parent) MUST return parent + 1, or None on overflow.
new_higher_pair(a, b) MUST return max(a, b) + 1, or None on overflow.

r[surelock-key-flow.progression]
Acquiring a lock MUST return a key at that lock's level when admitted.
Acquiring a lock group MUST return a key at the maximum level reached by
that group. Any lock or group below the current key level MUST be rejected.

r[surelock-key-flow.subscope]
Entering and leaving a subscope MUST preserve the current key level.

r[surelock-key-flow.no-backward]
Admitted surelock key transitions MUST be nondecreasing by level.
Backward transitions MUST be rejected.

r[surelock-lockset.canonical-ordering]
prepare_lockset MUST accept only same-level lock groups and produce a
canonical acquisition plan sorted by strictly increasing lock ID.

r[surelock-lockset.duplicate-rejection]
prepare_lockset MUST reject any candidate lock group that contains the
same lock ID more than once.

r[surelock-lockset.membership-preservation]
Canonical lock-set preparation MUST preserve lock membership: sorting MAY
change acquisition order but MUST NOT add, drop, or replace lock IDs.

r[surelock-lockset.caller-order-preservation]
caller_to_plan_positions MUST map each caller position back to the matching
lock in canonical plan, so logical caller order remains recoverable after
internal sorting.

r[surelock-deadlock-freedom.forward-wait-rank]
Every admitted wait edge MUST move strictly forward in lexicographic rank
(level, id). Same-level waits advance by ID; cross-level waits advance by
level.

r[surelock-deadlock-freedom.no-circular-wait]
Any wait graph whose every edge moves forward in surelock rank MUST be
acyclic.

r[surelock-deadlock-freedom.admitted-trace]
Any admitted surelock acquisition trace MUST be deadlock-free with respect
to circular wait.

## Cross-Module: Coordination

r[properties.election-token-is-fencing-issue]
election::compute_next_election_token and fencing::issue_token compute
the same value (current + 1, saturating at MAX).

r[properties.lock-expired-is-expiration-expired]
distributed_lock::is_lock_expired and expiration::is_expired use the
same predicate (now > deadline).

r[properties.lock-deadline-is-expiration-expires-at]
distributed_lock::compute_lock_deadline uses saturating addition like
expiration::expires_at (though with ms vs seconds granularity).

r[properties.rwlock-writer-token-is-fencing-issue]
rwlock::compute_next_write_token and fencing::issue_token compute the
same value.

r[properties.rwlock-expiry-is-expiration-expired]
rwlock::is_reader_expired and rwlock::is_writer_expired match
expiration::is_expired semantics.

r[properties.sequence-overflow-returns-none]
sequence::compute_batch_end and compute_range_start return None exactly
when addition would overflow u64.

## AppendEntries Consistency Check

r[append-entries.check]
check_append_entries(log, prev_log_index, prev_log_term) MUST return true
if and only if prev_log_index == 0 (empty prefix) OR the log has an entry
at prev_log_index - 1 whose term equals prev_log_term. MUST return false
when the log is too short or the term does not match. If two logs both
pass the check for the same (prev_log_index, prev_log_term), they MUST
agree at that index (same term).

## Log Conflict Resolution

r[log-conflict.find-conflict]
find_conflict(follower, leader_entries, start_index) MUST return the first
relative offset where the follower's log and leader's entries disagree on
term. MUST return None when all overlapping entries agree or when the
leader extends beyond the follower. The conflict offset MUST be within
leader_entries range. At the conflict point, terms MUST differ. Before
the conflict point, all terms MUST agree.

r[log-conflict.resolve]
resolve_conflict MUST truncate the follower log at the conflict point and
append leader entries from that point onward. When no conflict exists,
MUST append leader entries that extend beyond the follower. Entries before
the conflict point MUST be unchanged. The result MUST match leader entries
at all covered indices.

## Match Index Tracking

r[match-index.init]
init_match_indices(cluster_size) MUST return a sequence of cluster_size zeros.
init_next_indices(cluster_size, last_log_index) MUST return a sequence where
every element is last_log_index + 1.

r[match-index.update]
update_match_index(matches, server, new_match) MUST set matches[server] to
new_match. new_match MUST be >= matches[server] (monotonic). The update MUST
NOT modify any other server's match index. Length MUST be preserved.

r[match-index.backtrack]
backtrack_next_index(nexts, server) MUST decrement nexts[server] by 1, with
a floor of 1. The update MUST NOT modify any other server's next index.

r[match-index.count-replicated]
count_replicated(matches, index) MUST return the count of servers with
matchIndex >= index. The count MUST be non-negative and bounded by the
array length.

## Commit Index Advancement

r[commit-advance.term-guard]
can_commit_at(log, index, current_term) MUST return true only when
log[index-1].term == current_term. Prior-term entries MUST NOT be directly
committable. Index 0 MUST never be committable. This is the §5.4.2 rule.

r[commit-advance.quorum-check]
has_quorum_at(match_indices, index, cluster_size) MUST return true if and
only if the count of matchIndex[i] >= index constitutes a quorum. Delegates
to quorum::is_quorum.

r[commit-advance.advance]
advance_commit_index MUST return the largest index N where N > current_commit
AND can_commit_at(log, N, current_term) AND has_quorum_at(match_indices, N,
cluster_size). If no such N exists, MUST return current_commit. The result
MUST always be >= current_commit (monotonic). Empty log means no advancement.

## Term Authority

r[term-authority.step-down]
apply_higher_term(current_term, current_state, voted_for, message_term)
MUST adopt message_term, become follower, and clear votedFor when
message_term > current_term. MUST be a no-op when message_term <=
current_term. The resulting term MUST always be >= current_term.

## Leader Append-Only

r[leader-append-only.invariant]
leader_log_invariant(old_log, new_log) MUST return true if and only if
new_log.len() >= old_log.len() AND all entries at [0, old_log.len()) are
unchanged. The invariant MUST be reflexive and transitive. Truncation of
a non-empty log MUST violate the invariant.

r[leader-append-only.append]
leader_append_entry MUST append an entry with the given term and value.
The appended entry's term MUST equal current_term. Appending MUST
satisfy the leader log invariant. Multiple appends MUST compose.

## No-Op Commitment

r[noop-commit.make-noop]
make_noop_entry(current_term) MUST return a log entry with term ==
current_term and value == NOOP_VALUE (0). The entry MUST be recognized
by is_noop. Appending a no-op MUST preserve all prior log entries.

r[noop-commit.is-noop]
is_noop MUST return true if and only if entry.value == NOOP_VALUE.

r[noop-commit.commit-index]
noop_commit_index(log_len_before_noop) MUST return log_len_before_noop + 1.
Once committed, all entries at indices [0, log_len_before_noop) MUST be
below the commit index (committed as prefix).

## Leader Completeness

r[leader-completeness.quorum-overlap]
The commitment quorum and election quorum MUST overlap (pigeonhole via
quorum::prove_quorum_intersection). Two joint quorums sharing a voter
ensures the new leader has the committed entry.

r[leader-completeness.log-freshness]
A leader whose log is at least as up-to-date as the committed entry's
epoch (by epoch_ge) MUST have that entry. Vote granting requires epoch_ge,
so transitivity through the shared voter proves the leader has the entry.

## State Machine Safety

r[state-machine-safety.index-agreement]
If two logs have the same term at index i, they agree at that index (by
definition of agree_at). Same-term entries at the same index are identical.

r[state-machine-safety.prefix-agreement]
If two logs match on prefix [0, k), every entry in that prefix agrees.
Committed entries within a matching prefix are safe.

r[state-machine-safety.commit-safety]
If logs match through the commit point and an entry is committed (index <
commit_index), that entry is identical across both logs.

## Pre-Vote Protocol

r[pre-vote.grant]
can_grant_pre_vote MUST return true when candidate_term >= my_term AND the
candidate's log is at least as up-to-date (epoch_ge). MUST reject stale
candidates and outdated logs. The voter's term MUST NOT change.

r[pre-vote.start-election]
should_start_real_election MUST return true when pre-votes form a quorum.
Delegates to quorum::is_quorum.

## Read Index

r[read-index.confirm-authority]
confirm_read_authority MUST return true when ack_count forms a quorum.
Delegates to quorum::is_quorum. A deposed leader with only self-ack
MUST fail the check.

r[read-index.safe-at]
read_safe_at(read_index, commit_index) MUST return true when commit_index
>= read_index. MUST be monotonic in commit_index. The exact commit point
MUST be safe.

## Joint Consensus

r[joint-consensus.dual-quorum]
is_joint_quorum MUST return true when BOTH old and new configurations
independently form quorums. Two joint quorums MUST overlap in both configs.
Full clusters MUST always form a joint quorum.

## Install Snapshot

r[install-snapshot.trigger]
should_install_snapshot MUST return true when next_index <= first_log_index.

r[install-snapshot.apply]
apply_snapshot_commit MUST return max(current_commit, snapshot_index). The
commit index MUST never decrease.

r[install-snapshot.matching-entry]
has_matching_entry MUST return true when the log has an entry at
snapshot_index with the given term.

## Last Applied Tracking

r[last-applied.advance]
advance_last_applied(last_applied, commit_index) MUST return
min(last_applied + 1, commit_index) when last_applied < commit_index,
and last_applied otherwise. The result MUST always be >= last_applied
(monotonic) and <= commit_index (never applied past committed).

r[last-applied.can-apply]
can_apply(last_applied, commit_index) MUST return true if and only if
last_applied < commit_index. There is at least one committed entry
waiting to be applied.

r[last-applied.apply-count]
pending_apply_count(last_applied, commit_index) MUST return
commit_index - last_applied when commit_index >= last_applied, else 0.
This is the number of entries waiting to be applied.

r[last-applied.invariant]
The last-applied invariant MUST hold: last_applied <= commit_index.
Advancing last_applied MUST preserve the invariant. Advancing
commit_index (via commit_advance) MUST preserve the invariant.

r[last-applied.apply-entry-index]
next_apply_index(last_applied) MUST return last_applied + 1 (1-based
log index of the next entry to apply). The caller MUST ensure
can_apply is true before calling.

r[last-applied.batch-apply]
batch_apply_end(last_applied, commit_index, max_batch) MUST return
min(last_applied + max_batch, commit_index). The result MUST be
>= last_applied and <= commit_index. The batch size MUST NOT exceed
max_batch.

## Leadership Transfer

r[leadership-transfer.can-start]
can_start_transfer(state, target_id, self_id) MUST return true if and
only if state == Leader AND target_id != self_id. A non-leader MUST
NOT initiate transfer. Self-transfer MUST be rejected.

r[leadership-transfer.target-caught-up]
is_target_caught_up(target_match_index, last_log_index) MUST return
true if and only if target_match_index >= last_log_index. The leader
MUST NOT send TimeoutNow until the target has replicated all entries.

r[leadership-transfer.should-send-timeout-now]
should_send_timeout_now(is_leader, target_caught_up, transfer_deadline,
now) MUST return true when all of: state is leader, target is caught
up, and now <= transfer_deadline (transfer has not expired). An expired
transfer MUST return false.

r[leadership-transfer.transfer-expired]
is_transfer_expired(transfer_deadline, now) MUST return true when
now > transfer_deadline. An expired transfer MUST be abandoned —
the leader resumes normal operation.

r[leadership-transfer.blocks-new-proposals]
should_reject_proposal(transfer_in_progress) MUST return true when a
transfer is in progress. The leader MUST NOT accept new client proposals
during transfer.

r[leadership-transfer.abort]
can_abort_transfer(is_leader, transfer_in_progress) MUST return true
when both hold. Aborting clears the transfer state and resumes normal
operation. Aborting a non-existent transfer MUST be a no-op.

## Log Compaction

r[log-compaction.should-compact]
should_compact(log_len, snapshot_threshold) MUST return true when
log_len >= snapshot_threshold. A threshold of 0 MUST always trigger.
A log shorter than the threshold MUST NOT trigger.

r[log-compaction.compact]
compact_log(log, snapshot_index) MUST discard all entries at indices
[0, snapshot_index) and return the suffix starting at snapshot_index.
The result length MUST equal log.len() - snapshot_index when
snapshot_index <= log.len(). If snapshot_index > log.len(), the
result MUST be empty.

r[log-compaction.prefix-removed]
After compaction, no entry from the original [0, snapshot_index) range
is present in the result. The first entry of the result (if non-empty)
corresponds to the original entry at snapshot_index.

r[log-compaction.suffix-preserved]
All entries at indices [snapshot_index, log.len()) MUST be preserved
in the result, with their terms and values unchanged. For all i in
[0, result.len()): result[i] == original[snapshot_index + i].

r[log-compaction.first-index-after]
first_log_index_after_compaction(prev_first_index, snapshot_index) MUST
return max(prev_first_index, snapshot_index). The first log index MUST
never decrease.

r[log-compaction.offset-translation]
translate_index(absolute_index, first_log_index) MUST return
absolute_index - first_log_index when absolute_index >= first_log_index,
and None otherwise. Indices before the compacted region are inaccessible.

r[log-compaction.compact-preserves-commit]
Compacting entries below the commit index MUST NOT change the commit
index. snapshot_index MUST be <= commit_index (never compact uncommitted
entries).

## Heartbeat

r[heartbeat.is-heartbeat]
is_heartbeat(entry_count) MUST return true if and only if entry_count == 0.
A heartbeat is an AppendEntries RPC carrying no log entries.

r[heartbeat.should-send]
should_send_heartbeat(elapsed_ms, heartbeat_interval_ms) MUST return true
when elapsed_ms >= heartbeat_interval_ms. The leader MUST send heartbeats
at the configured interval.

r[heartbeat.reset-election-timer]
should_reset_election_timer(msg_term, current_term, from_leader) MUST
return true when msg_term >= current_term AND from_leader is true. A
valid heartbeat from the current leader resets the follower's election
timer. Messages from non-leaders or stale terms MUST NOT reset the timer.

r[heartbeat.leader-alive]
is_leader_alive(last_heartbeat_time, now, election_timeout) MUST return
true when now - last_heartbeat_time < election_timeout (using saturating
subtraction). A follower considers the leader alive while heartbeats
arrive within the election timeout.

r[heartbeat.ack]
heartbeat_ack_valid(ack_term, leader_term) MUST return true when
ack_term == leader_term. Stale acks (ack_term < leader_term) MUST be
ignored. Higher-term acks trigger step-down via term_authority.

## Client Session

r[client-session.register]
register_session(next_session_id) MUST return (session_id, next_id + 1).
Session IDs MUST be monotonically increasing. Registration MUST be
logged as a Raft entry so all replicas track the same sessions.

r[client-session.is-duplicate]
is_duplicate_request(session_table_seq, request_seq) MUST return true
when request_seq <= session_table_seq. A request with a sequence number
at or below the last processed sequence for that session MUST be
treated as duplicate.

r[client-session.advance-seq]
advance_session_seq(current_seq, request_seq) MUST return request_seq
when request_seq > current_seq. The session's sequence number MUST
only move forward.

r[client-session.lookup]
session_exists(table_len, session_id) MUST return true when session_id
< table_len. Sessions are densely packed from 0.

r[client-session.expire]
is_session_expired(last_activity, now, session_timeout) MUST return
true when now - last_activity >= session_timeout (saturating
subtraction). Expired sessions MAY be reclaimed.

r[client-session.response-cache]
cached_response_valid(cached_seq, request_seq) MUST return true when
cached_seq == request_seq. The cached response for a duplicate request
MUST be returned without re-executing the command.

r[client-session.table-bounded]
session_count_within_limit(count, max_sessions) MUST return true when
count < max_sessions. Registration MUST be rejected when the table
is full.

## Lease Read

r[lease-read.is-valid]
is_lease_valid(lease_start, election_timeout, clock_drift_bound, now)
MUST return true when now < lease_start + election_timeout -
clock_drift_bound (all saturating arithmetic). The lease MUST expire
strictly before any other server's election timeout fires, accounting
for worst-case clock drift.

r[lease-read.start]
start_lease(now) MUST record now as the lease start time. The lease
begins when the leader confirms authority via a quorum of heartbeat
responses.

r[lease-read.disjoint]
Two leases from different leaders MUST NOT overlap in time. If leader A's
lease ends at time T_a and leader B's lease starts at T_b, then T_b >=
T_a. This follows from: the new leader's election required a quorum,
which includes at least one node that would have let leader A's lease
expire before voting.

r[lease-read.requires-commit]
lease_read_safe(lease_valid, commit_index, read_index) MUST return true
only when lease_valid AND commit_index >= read_index. A valid lease alone
is insufficient — the read must also wait for its commit point, same as
read_index.

r[lease-read.leader-only]
Only a node in Leader state MUST be permitted to serve lease reads.
Followers and candidates MUST reject lease read requests.

## Follower Redirect

r[follower-redirect.should-redirect]
should_redirect(state, known_leader_id) MUST return true when state !=
Leader AND known_leader_id is Some. Followers and candidates with a known
leader MUST redirect clients. A follower with no known leader MUST NOT
redirect (return error instead).

r[follower-redirect.leader-hint]
leader_hint(known_leader_id) MUST return the leader's node ID when known,
or a sentinel (u64::MAX) when unknown. The hint is best-effort — it MAY
be stale after a leader change.

r[follower-redirect.hint-freshness]
is_hint_fresh(hint_term, current_term) MUST return true when hint_term ==
current_term. A hint from a prior term MUST be considered stale. Clients
receiving a stale hint MUST retry discovery.

r[follower-redirect.leader-accepts]
should_accept_request(state) MUST return true if and only if state ==
Leader. Only the leader processes client requests directly.

## Snapshot Transfer

r[snapshot-transfer.chunk-valid]
is_chunk_valid(offset, chunk_size, total_size) MUST return true when
offset + chunk_size <= total_size (saturating addition to avoid overflow).
A zero-size chunk MUST be invalid. Offset beyond total_size MUST be
invalid.

r[snapshot-transfer.is-first-chunk]
is_first_chunk(offset) MUST return true if and only if offset == 0.
The first chunk starts at the beginning of the snapshot data.

r[snapshot-transfer.is-last-chunk]
is_last_chunk(offset, chunk_size, total_size) MUST return true when
offset + chunk_size == total_size. The last chunk ends exactly at
the snapshot boundary.

r[snapshot-transfer.next-offset]
next_expected_offset(current_offset, chunk_size) MUST return
current_offset + chunk_size. The receiver tracks the next expected
offset for in-order delivery. Returns None on overflow.

r[snapshot-transfer.all-chunks-cover]
For a complete transfer, the chunks MUST cover [0, total_size) with
no gaps and no overlaps. The sum of all chunk sizes MUST equal
total_size.

r[snapshot-transfer.chunk-count]
chunk_count(total_size, chunk_size) MUST return ceil(total_size /
chunk_size) when chunk_size > 0. This is the number of chunks needed
to transfer the full snapshot.

r[snapshot-transfer.progress]
transfer_progress(received_bytes, total_size) MUST return a value in
[0, 100] representing the percentage complete. 0 when received == 0.
100 when received >= total_size. Monotonically increasing as bytes
arrive.

## Cross-Module: Last Applied

r[properties.last-applied-bounded-by-commit]
advance_last_applied result MUST always be <= commit_index. The
apply cursor never overshoots the commit cursor.

r[properties.last-applied-advance-is-monotonic]
advance_last_applied satisfies monotonic::is_advance on last_applied.
The apply cursor never moves backward.

r[properties.pending-apply-is-saturating-sub]
pending_apply_count(last_applied, commit_index) MUST equal
arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(commit_index, last_applied). The
pending count is the gap computed by generic saturating subtraction.

## Cross-Module: Leadership Transfer

r[properties.transfer-caught-up-is-advance]
is_target_caught_up(match, last) is equivalent to
monotonic::is_advance(last, match) — the target's match index has
reached the leader's log end.

r[properties.transfer-blocks-like-drain]
should_reject_proposal(true) mirrors drain::can_start_op(true) == false.
Both gate new work during a shutdown/transfer protocol.

r[properties.transfer-timeout-is-expiration]
is_transfer_expired(deadline, now) MUST equal
expiration::is_expired(deadline, now). Transfer timeout uses the same
predicate as lease/lock expiration.

## Cross-Module: Log Compaction

r[properties.compact-suffix-length-is-saturating-sub]
The length of compact_log result MUST equal
arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(log.len(), snapshot_index). Compaction
length is a saturating subtraction.

r[properties.compact-first-index-is-max]
first_log_index_after_compaction(prev, snap) MUST equal
ordering::max_spec(prev, snap). The first index is the max of old and
new.

r[properties.compact-offset-uses-checked-sub]
translate_index returns None exactly when the absolute index is below
first_log_index — same condition as a checked subtraction underflow.

r[properties.compact-preserves-install-snapshot-trigger]
After compaction with snapshot_index S, should_install_snapshot(next, S)
holds for any follower with next <= S. Compaction creates the exact
condition that triggers snapshot installation.

## Cross-Module: Heartbeat

r[properties.heartbeat-interval-less-than-election]
raft_timing::validate_timing_order(heartbeat, election_min) ensures
heartbeat < election_min. Combined with heartbeat::should_send, a
leader sends multiple heartbeats per election timeout period.

r[properties.heartbeat-reset-prevents-election]
If should_reset_election_timer returns true and the follower resets,
then is_leader_alive returns true (leader still considered alive).
Valid heartbeats prevent spurious elections.

r[properties.heartbeat-ack-stale-triggers-step-down]
A heartbeat ack with ack_term > leader_term triggers
term_authority::apply_higher_term, which returns a TermUpdate with
new_state == FOLLOWER.

## Cross-Module: Client Session

r[properties.session-register-is-strict-advance]
Successive register_session calls produce session IDs satisfying
monotonic::is_strict_advance. Session IDs never repeat.

r[properties.session-duplicate-is-fencing]
is_duplicate_request(table_seq, req_seq) mirrors
fencing::is_valid_write(req_seq, table_seq) == false when req_seq
<= table_seq. Duplicate detection is stale-write rejection.

r[properties.session-expire-is-expiration]
is_session_expired(last_activity, now, timeout) MUST match
expiration::is_expired(last_activity + timeout, now). Session expiry
uses the same temporal predicate.

## Cross-Module: Lease Read

r[properties.lease-read-implies-read-index-safe]
When lease_read_safe returns true, read_index::read_safe_at(read_index,
commit_index) also returns true. Lease reads are strictly stronger than
ReadIndex — they add a lease validity check on top of the commit check.

r[properties.lease-disjoint-is-lease-disjointness]
The lease-read disjointness property relies on lease::leases_disjoint
when the same resource_id is used. The two modules agree on temporal
non-overlap.

## Check Quorum

r[check-quorum.recent-contact]
has_recent_contact(last_contact, now, election_timeout) MUST return
true when now - last_contact < election_timeout (saturating
subtraction). A follower that has contacted the leader within the
election timeout is considered recent.

r[check-quorum.count-recent]
count_recent_contacts(contacts, now, election_timeout, cluster_size)
MUST return the count of servers (including self) with recent contact.
The leader always counts itself (contact time == now).

r[check-quorum.should-step-down]
should_step_down(recent_count, cluster_size) MUST return true when
recent_count < majority(cluster_size). A leader that cannot confirm
a quorum of recent contacts MUST step down to prevent serving stale
data from a network partition.

r[check-quorum.leader-counts-self]
The leader's own contact time is always current (now), so it always
counts as 1 towards the recent quorum. A singleton cluster (size 1)
MUST never step down.

r[check-quorum.partitioned-leader]
A fully partitioned leader (only self responding) with cluster_size > 1
MUST step down. recent_count == 1 < majority(n) for n >= 2.

## Learner Readiness

r[learner-readiness.is-caught-up]
is_caught_up(learner_match, leader_log_len) MUST return true when
learner_match >= leader_log_len. The learner has replicated all
entries the leader currently has.

r[learner-readiness.replication-gap]
replication_gap(learner_match, leader_log_len) MUST return
leader_log_len - learner_match when leader_log_len >= learner_match,
else 0. This is the number of entries the learner still needs.

r[learner-readiness.is-within-threshold]
is_within_threshold(learner_match, leader_log_len, threshold) MUST
return true when replication_gap <= threshold. The learner is close
enough to be promoted without significant downtime.

r[learner-readiness.promotion-safe]
promotion_safe(learner_match, leader_log_len, cluster_size) MUST
return true when is_caught_up AND cluster_size > 0. Promotion requires
both replication completeness and a valid cluster.

r[learner-readiness.gap-monotonic]
If learner_match increases (more entries replicated), the replication
gap MUST decrease or stay the same. Monotonic progress toward readiness.

## Replication Pipeline

r[replication-pipeline.inflight-count]
inflight_count(next_index, match_index) MUST return next_index -
match_index - 1 when next_index > match_index + 1, else 0. This is
the number of entries sent but not yet acknowledged.

r[replication-pipeline.can-send-more]
can_send_more(next_index, match_index, max_inflight) MUST return true
when inflight_count < max_inflight. The leader can pipeline more
entries without exceeding the flow control window.

r[replication-pipeline.window-after-send]
window_after_send(next_index, match_index, entries_sent, max_inflight)
MUST return the new next_index (next_index + entries_sent). The caller
MUST ensure entries_sent <= available window (max_inflight -
inflight_count).

r[replication-pipeline.window-after-ack]
window_after_ack(match_index, new_match) MUST return new_match when
new_match > match_index. Acknowledging entries frees window capacity.
The new inflight count MUST be <= the old inflight count.

r[replication-pipeline.full-window-blocks]
When inflight_count >= max_inflight, can_send_more MUST return false.
A full pipeline blocks further sends until acks arrive.

r[replication-pipeline.empty-window]
When next_index == match_index + 1, inflight_count MUST be 0 and
can_send_more MUST return true (assuming max_inflight > 0). A fully
acknowledged pipeline has full capacity.

## Cross-Module: Check Quorum

r[properties.check-quorum-uses-quorum]
should_step_down delegates to !is_quorum(recent_count, cluster_size).
The step-down decision is the negation of the quorum predicate.

r[properties.check-quorum-singleton-safe]
A singleton cluster (size 1) with leader counting self MUST have
recent_count == 1 == majority(1), so should_step_down returns false.
Singletons never step down.

## Cross-Module: Learner Readiness

r[properties.learner-caught-up-is-advance]
is_caught_up(match, len) is equivalent to monotonic::is_advance(len,
match). The learner's match index has reached the leader's log length.

r[properties.learner-gap-is-saturating-sub]
replication_gap(match, len) equals arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(len,
match). The gap is a saturating subtraction.

## Cross-Module: Replication Pipeline

r[properties.pipeline-inflight-is-saturating-sub]
inflight_count(next, match) equals
arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(next, match + 1) when next > match.
Inflight tracking is a saturating subtraction.

r[properties.pipeline-empty-after-full-ack]
When new_match == next_index - 1 (all sent entries acknowledged),
inflight_count(next_index, new_match) == 0. Full acknowledgment
empties the pipeline.

## Cross-Module: Snapshot Transfer

r[properties.snapshot-chunk-count-is-div-ceil]
chunk_count(total, chunk_size) MUST equal arithmetic::div_ceil(total,
chunk_size). Chunking and ceiling division are the same computation.

r[properties.snapshot-transfer-triggers-install]
After a complete snapshot transfer (all chunks received), the follower
applies install_snapshot::apply_snapshot_commit. The transfer layer
feeds into the installation layer.

## Follower Commit Update

r[follower-commit.update]
follower_update_commit(current_commit, leader_commit, last_new_entry_index)
MUST return min(leader_commit, last_new_entry_index) when that value exceeds
current_commit, otherwise current_commit. This is the follower-side commit
advancement from Raft's AppendEntries receiver (§5.3).

r[follower-commit.monotonic]
The result of follower_update_commit MUST always be >= current_commit. The
follower's commit index MUST never decrease.

r[follower-commit.bounded-by-leader]
The result MUST always be <= leader_commit. A follower MUST NOT commit
beyond what the leader has committed.

r[follower-commit.bounded-by-log]
The result MUST always be <= last_new_entry_index. A follower MUST NOT
commit beyond the last entry it actually has in its log.

## Election Timer

r[election-timer.reset-on-append-entries]
should_reset_on_append_entries(msg_term, current_term, is_success) MUST
return true when msg_term >= current_term AND is_success is true. A valid
AppendEntries from the current leader resets the follower's election timer.
Stale-term messages MUST NOT reset the timer.

r[election-timer.reset-on-vote-grant]
should_reset_on_vote_grant(voted) MUST return true when voted is true.
Granting a vote resets the election timer because a valid candidate exists.

r[election-timer.reset-on-election-start]
should_reset_on_election_start(became_candidate) MUST return true when
became_candidate is true. Starting an election resets the timer so the
candidate waits a full timeout before retrying.

r[election-timer.expired]
is_election_timer_expired(elapsed_ms, election_timeout_ms) MUST return
true when elapsed_ms >= election_timeout_ms. The timer fires when the
full timeout has elapsed without a reset event.

r[election-timer.should-start-election]
should_start_election(is_follower, timer_expired) MUST return true when
both conditions hold. Only followers with expired timers start elections.
Leaders and candidates MUST NOT start new elections via timer.

## Candidate Election Initiation

r[election-init.new-term]
init_election_term(current_term) MUST return current_term + 1. The
candidate increments its term before requesting votes. MUST return None
when current_term == u64::MAX (overflow protection).

r[election-init.self-vote]
init_self_vote(candidate_id, new_term) MUST return a VoteState with
voted_term == new_term and voted_for == candidate_id. The candidate
votes for itself as the first step of the election.

r[election-init.initial-vote-count]
init_vote_count() MUST return 1. The candidate starts with one vote
(its own self-vote).

r[election-init.new-state]
init_election_state() MUST return STATE_TRANSITIONING. The candidate
transitions from Follower to Transitioning (candidate) state.

r[election-init.self-vote-is-valid]
The self-vote produced by init_self_vote MUST satisfy
can_grant_vote_spec when the candidate's log is compared against
itself. A node always considers its own log up-to-date enough.

## Vote Response Tally

r[vote-tally.record-vote]
record_vote(votes, server_id, cluster_size) MUST set votes[server_id]
to true when server_id < cluster_size. The operation MUST NOT modify
any other server's vote. Duplicate votes for the same server MUST be
idempotent (already true stays true).

r[vote-tally.count-votes]
count_votes(votes) MUST return the number of true entries in the vote
array. The count MUST be <= votes.len().

r[vote-tally.has-won]
has_won_election(votes, cluster_size) MUST return true when
count_votes(votes) constitutes a quorum of cluster_size. Delegates
to quorum::is_quorum.

r[vote-tally.is-stale-response]
is_stale_vote_response(response_term, current_term) MUST return true
when response_term != current_term. Votes from a different term MUST
be ignored. Only same-term votes count toward election victory.

r[vote-tally.init-votes]
init_vote_tally(cluster_size) MUST return a sequence of cluster_size
false values. No server has voted yet.

r[vote-tally.init-with-self-vote]
init_with_self_vote(cluster_size, self_id) MUST return a tally with
votes[self_id] set to true and all others false. The candidate starts
with its own vote counted.

## AppendEntries Response Dispatch

r[append-response.classify]
classify_append_response(response_term, current_term, success) MUST
return: HIGHER_TERM (0) when response_term > current_term, STALE (1)
when response_term < current_term, SUCCESS (2) when response_term ==
current_term and success is true, FAILURE (3) when response_term ==
current_term and success is false. The four cases MUST be exhaustive
and mutually exclusive.

r[append-response.on-success]
on_append_success(match_index, next_index, entries_sent) MUST return
(new_match, new_next) where new_match = match_index + entries_sent and
new_next = new_match + 1. The match index advances to cover the
acknowledged entries. The next index moves past them.

r[append-response.on-failure]
on_append_failure(next_index) MUST return max(next_index - 1, 1).
The leader backs off by one index, with a floor of 1. This is the
basic (non-accelerated) backtrack from §5.3.

r[append-response.match-advances]
After on_append_success, the new match index MUST be >= the old match
index. Match indices are monotonic.

r[append-response.next-after-success]
After on_append_success, new_next MUST equal new_match + 1. The next
index always points one past the match index after success.

## Log Entry Type Routing

r[entry-type.classify]
classify_entry(entry) MUST return ENTRY_NORMAL (0) when entry.value !=
NOOP_VALUE and entry.value != CONFIG_CHANGE_SENTINEL, ENTRY_NOOP (1)
when entry.value == NOOP_VALUE, ENTRY_CONFIG (2) when entry.value ==
CONFIG_CHANGE_SENTINEL. The three types MUST be exhaustive.

r[entry-type.should-apply]
should_apply_to_state_machine(entry_type) MUST return true for
ENTRY_NORMAL, false for ENTRY_NOOP and ENTRY_CONFIG. Only normal
command entries affect state machine output. No-ops and config changes
are handled separately.

r[entry-type.is-config-change]
is_config_change(entry_type) MUST return true only for ENTRY_CONFIG.
Config changes take effect when appended to the log, not when committed.

r[entry-type.takes-effect-on-append]
takes_effect_on_append(entry_type) MUST return true for ENTRY_CONFIG,
false for ENTRY_NORMAL and ENTRY_NOOP. Config entries are the only
type that changes system behavior on append rather than commit.

r[entry-type.is-noop]
is_noop_entry(entry_type) MUST return true only for ENTRY_NOOP. No-op
entries are identity operations inserted by new leaders.

## Cross-Module: Follower Commit

r[properties.follower-commit-monotonic-is-advance]
follower_update_commit result satisfies monotonic::is_advance on the
commit index. The follower's commit cursor never moves backward.

## Cross-Module: Election Timer

r[properties.election-timer-heartbeat-resets]
If should_reset_on_append_entries returns true and the follower resets
its timer, then is_election_timer_expired returns false (timer not
expired immediately after reset).

## Cross-Module: Vote Tally

r[properties.vote-tally-quorum-is-quorum]
has_won_election delegates to quorum::is_quorum. Election victory
requires the same majority threshold as any other quorum decision.

## Cross-Module: AppendEntries Response

r[properties.append-response-success-advances-match]
on_append_success produces a match index that satisfies
monotonic::is_advance on the previous match index.

## Cross-Module: Entry Type

r[properties.entry-type-noop-agrees]
classify_entry with NOOP_VALUE produces ENTRY_NOOP, which agrees with
noop_commit::is_noop_spec.

## Replication Mode

r[replication-mode.valid-mode]
is_valid_mode MUST return true if and only if mode is PROBE (0),
REPLICATE (1), or SNAPSHOT (2). All transitions MUST preserve validity.

r[replication-mode.can-pipeline]
can_pipeline MUST return true if and only if mode is REPLICATE. Probe
and Snapshot modes MUST NOT allow pipelining.

r[replication-mode.can-send-entries]
can_send_entries MUST return true for PROBE and REPLICATE, false for
SNAPSHOT. Snapshot mode sends snapshot chunks, not log entries.

r[replication-mode.transition-on-success]
transition_on_success MUST move PROBE to REPLICATE (match point
discovered). REPLICATE stays in REPLICATE. SNAPSHOT is unchanged.

r[replication-mode.transition-on-reject]
transition_on_reject MUST move REPLICATE back to PROBE (match point
wrong). PROBE stays in PROBE. SNAPSHOT is unchanged.

r[replication-mode.transition-to-snapshot]
should_send_snapshot MUST return true when next_index <= first_log_index.
The follower needs entries that have been compacted.

r[replication-mode.enter-snapshot]
enter_snapshot MUST switch PROBE or REPLICATE to SNAPSHOT. Already in
SNAPSHOT is unchanged.

r[replication-mode.snapshot-complete]
snapshot_complete MUST switch SNAPSHOT to PROBE (resume probing from
snapshot's last index). Other modes unchanged.

r[replication-mode.entries-per-message]
entries_per_message MUST return 1 for PROBE, max_batch for REPLICATE,
and 0 for SNAPSHOT.

## Pre-Vote Tally

r[pre-vote-tally.init]
init_pre_vote_tally MUST create a boolean sequence of cluster_size
with all values false.

r[pre-vote-tally.init-with-self]
init_with_self_pre_vote MUST create a tally with only the candidate's
own position set to true.

r[pre-vote-tally.record]
record_pre_vote MUST set the server's position to true. Recording MUST
be idempotent. Other positions MUST be unchanged.

r[pre-vote-tally.count]
count_pre_votes MUST return the number of true entries. The count MUST
be bounded by the tally length.

r[pre-vote-tally.has-quorum]
has_pre_vote_quorum MUST return true if and only if the pre-vote count
constitutes a quorum of cluster_size.

r[pre-vote-tally.stale-response]
is_stale_pre_vote_response MUST return true when the response term
differs from the prospective term.

## Follower Read

r[follower-read.register]
register_read MUST return the follower's current commit_index as the
read's minimum freshness guarantee.

r[follower-read.leader-confirms]
safe_read_point MUST return max(read_index, leader_commit). The safe
point MUST be >= both the original read_index and the leader's commit.

r[follower-read.can-serve]
can_serve_read MUST return true if and only if last_applied >= safe_point.
can_serve and entries_behind == 0 MUST be equivalent.

r[follower-read.stale-leader]
is_leader_stale MUST return true when the response term differs from
the registered term. Same term MUST return false.

r[follower-read.timeout]
is_read_timed_out MUST return true when now >= registered_at + timeout.
At registration time with timeout > 0, MUST return false.

r[follower-read.entries-behind]
entries_behind MUST return safe_point - last_applied when behind, 0 when
caught up. Applying entries MUST reduce the behind count.

## Request Forward

r[request-forward.can-forward]
can_forward MUST return true only when is_follower AND leader_known AND
pending_count < max_pending. Non-followers MUST NOT forward.

r[request-forward.after-forward]
after_forward MUST return pending_count + 1.

r[request-forward.after-response]
after_response MUST return pending_count - 1 when positive, 0 when zero.
Forward then response MUST be a roundtrip.

r[request-forward.expired]
is_forward_expired MUST return true when now >= forward_time + timeout.

r[request-forward.clear-on-leader-change]
should_clear_pending MUST return true when new_term > old_leader_term.
Same term MUST return false.

r[request-forward.decision]
forward_decision MUST return ACCEPT for leaders, FORWARD when
can_forward holds, REJECT otherwise. The result MUST be 0, 1, or 2.

## Commit Notify

r[commit-notify.count]
newly_committed_count MUST return new_commit - old_commit when
advanced, 0 otherwise. No advancement means zero.

r[commit-notify.is-newly-committed]
is_newly_committed MUST return true for indices in (old_commit,
new_commit]. The old commit and indices beyond new_commit MUST be false.

r[commit-notify.first-committed]
first_newly_committed MUST return old_commit + 1.

r[commit-notify.should-notify]
should_notify MUST return true if and only if newly_committed_count > 0.

r[commit-notify.proposal-status]
proposal_status MUST return COMMITTED when index <= commit_index (wins
over expired), EXPIRED when not committed and expired, PENDING otherwise.
Committed MUST be monotonic: once committed, stays committed.

r[commit-notify.count-ready]
count_ready_proposals MUST count proposals that are committed or expired.
The count MUST be bounded by the input length.

## Compaction Fence

r[compaction-fence.safe-to-compact]
is_safe_to_compact MUST return true when compact_index < min_next_index.
Compaction at 0 MUST always be safe.

r[compaction-fence.min-next-index]
min_active_next MUST return the minimum next_index across followers that
are NOT in snapshot mode, excluding self. All-snapshot MUST return MAX.

r[compaction-fence.needs-snapshot]
needs_snapshot_switch MUST return true when follower_next <= first_log_index.
Within-log followers MUST return false.

r[compaction-fence.safe-compact-index]
safe_compact_index MUST return min(desired, min_next - 1). The result
MUST be < min_next and <= desired.

## Witness

r[witness.valid-role]
is_valid_role MUST return true for VOTER (0), WITNESS (1), LEARNER (2).

r[witness.can-vote]
can_vote MUST return true for VOTER and WITNESS, false for LEARNER.

r[witness.can-be-leader]
can_be_leader MUST return true only for VOTER. Leader implies voter.
Leader implies full log.

r[witness.receives-log]
receives_full_log MUST return true for VOTER and LEARNER, false for
WITNESS.

r[witness.can-ack-heartbeat]
can_ack_heartbeat MUST return true for VOTER and WITNESS when
leader_term >= my_term. Stale heartbeats MUST be rejected.

r[witness.entry-retained]
entry_retained MUST return true when entry_index >= snapshot_index.

r[witness.quorum-with-witnesses]
quorum_members MUST return voter_count + witness_count. Witnesses
contribute to quorum count.

r[witness.reject-witness-candidate]
should_reject_candidate MUST return true for WITNESS and LEARNER.
Voter candidates MUST NOT be rejected.

## Priority Election

r[priority-election.should-yield]
should_yield MUST return true when other_priority > my_priority AND
other_log_current. Same priority MUST NOT yield. Outdated log MUST NOT
cause yield.

r[priority-election.delay]
election_delay MUST return base_timeout + (max_priority - my_priority)
* delay_per_level (saturating). Highest priority MUST get base_timeout.
Lower priority MUST get >= base_timeout.

r[priority-election.step-down]
should_step_down_for_priority MUST return true when a higher-priority
node is ready AND the grace period has expired.

r[priority-election.compare-candidates]
compare_candidates MUST prefer the candidate with the fresher log
regardless of priority. When logs are equal, higher priority wins.
Equal candidates MUST return 0.

r[priority-election.is-highest]
is_highest_priority MUST return true when my_priority >= max_cluster_priority.

## Learner Change

r[learner-change.can-add]
can_add_learner MUST return false for voters, during pending config
changes, and when at max learners. Adding an existing learner MUST
always be allowed (idempotent).

r[learner-change.add-result]
add_learner_result MUST return count + 1 for new learners, count for
existing learners (idempotent).

r[learner-change.can-remove]
can_remove_learner MUST return false for non-learners, promoting
learners, and during pending config changes.

r[learner-change.remove-result]
remove_learner_result MUST return count - 1 for learners with count > 0,
count for non-learners. Add then remove MUST be a roundtrip.

r[learner-change.quorum-unaffected]
quorum_unchanged MUST verify voter_count_before == voter_count_after.
Learner operations MUST NOT change the quorum calculation.

## Pre-Vote Lease

r[pre-vote-lease.reject]
should_reject_pre_vote MUST return true when has_leader_contact AND
candidate_term <= my_term. No contact MUST NOT reject. Higher candidate
term MUST bypass the check. Partitioned same-term nodes MUST be blocked.

r[pre-vote-lease.combined-decision]
combined_pre_vote_decision MUST compose CheckQuorum rejection with
standard pre-vote check. Rejection prevents grant. Without CheckQuorum,
reduces to standard pre-vote.

r[pre-vote-lease.leader-contact]
has_leader_within_timeout MUST return true when now - last_contact <
election_timeout. Zero elapsed with timeout > 0 MUST be true. Elapsed
>= timeout MUST be false.

## Heartbeat

r[heartbeat.is-heartbeat]
is_heartbeat(entry_count) MUST return true if and only if entry_count == 0.
A heartbeat is an AppendEntries RPC carrying no log entries.

r[heartbeat.should-send]
should_send_heartbeat(elapsed_ms, heartbeat_interval_ms) MUST return true
when elapsed_ms >= heartbeat_interval_ms. The leader MUST send heartbeats
at the configured interval.

r[heartbeat.reset-election-timer]
should_reset_election_timer(msg_term, current_term, from_leader) MUST
return true when msg_term >= current_term AND from_leader is true. A
valid heartbeat from the current leader resets the follower's election
timer. Messages from non-leaders or stale terms MUST NOT reset the timer.

r[heartbeat.leader-alive]
is_leader_alive(last_heartbeat_time, now, election_timeout) MUST return
true when now - last_heartbeat_time < election_timeout (using saturating
subtraction). A follower considers the leader alive while heartbeats
arrive within the election timeout.

r[heartbeat.ack]
heartbeat_ack_valid(ack_term, leader_term) MUST return true when
ack_term == leader_term. Stale acks (ack_term < leader_term) MUST be
ignored. Higher-term acks trigger step-down via term_authority.

## Cross-Module: Heartbeat

r[properties.heartbeat-interval-less-than-election]
raft_timing::validate_timing_order(heartbeat, election_min) ensures
heartbeat < election_min. Combined with heartbeat::should_send, a
leader sends multiple heartbeats per election timeout period.

r[properties.heartbeat-reset-prevents-election]
If should_reset_election_timer returns true and the follower resets,
then is_leader_alive returns true (leader still considered alive).
Valid heartbeats prevent spurious elections.

r[properties.heartbeat-ack-stale-triggers-step-down]
A heartbeat ack with ack_term > leader_term triggers
term_authority::apply_higher_term, which returns a TermUpdate with
new_state == FOLLOWER.

## Log Compaction

r[log-compaction.should-compact]
should_compact(log_len, snapshot_threshold) MUST return true when
log_len >= snapshot_threshold. A threshold of 0 MUST always trigger.
A log shorter than the threshold MUST NOT trigger.

r[log-compaction.compact]
compact_log(log, snapshot_index) MUST discard all entries at indices
[0, snapshot_index) and return the suffix starting at snapshot_index.
The result length MUST equal log.len() - snapshot_index when
snapshot_index <= log.len(). If snapshot_index > log.len(), the
result MUST be empty.

r[log-compaction.prefix-removed]
After compaction, no entry from the original [0, snapshot_index) range
is present in the result. The first entry of the result (if non-empty)
corresponds to the original entry at snapshot_index.

r[log-compaction.suffix-preserved]
All entries at indices [snapshot_index, log.len()) MUST be preserved
in the result, with their terms and values unchanged. For all i in
[0, result.len()): result[i] == original[snapshot_index + i].

r[log-compaction.first-index-after]
first_log_index_after_compaction(prev_first_index, snapshot_index) MUST
return max(prev_first_index, snapshot_index). The first log index MUST
never decrease.

r[log-compaction.offset-translation]
translate_index(absolute_index, first_log_index) MUST return
absolute_index - first_log_index when absolute_index >= first_log_index,
and None otherwise. Indices before the compacted region are inaccessible.

r[log-compaction.compact-preserves-commit]
Compacting entries below the commit index MUST NOT change the commit
index. snapshot_index MUST be <= commit_index (never compact uncommitted
entries).

## Cross-Module: Log Compaction

r[properties.compact-suffix-length-is-saturating-sub]
The length of compact_log result MUST equal
arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(log.len(), snapshot_index). Compaction
length is a saturating subtraction.

r[properties.compact-first-index-is-max]
first_log_index_after_compaction(prev, snap) MUST equal
ordering::max_spec(prev, snap). The first index is the max of old and
new.

r[properties.compact-offset-uses-checked-sub]
translate_index returns None exactly when the absolute index is below
first_log_index — same condition as a checked subtraction underflow.

r[properties.compact-preserves-install-snapshot-trigger]
After compaction with snapshot_index S, should_install_snapshot(next, S)
holds for any follower with next <= S. Compaction creates the exact
condition that triggers snapshot installation.

## Follower Redirect

r[follower-redirect.should-redirect]
should_redirect(state, known_leader_id) MUST return true when state !=
Leader AND known_leader_id is Some. Followers and candidates with a known
leader MUST redirect clients. A follower with no known leader MUST NOT
redirect (return error instead).

r[follower-redirect.leader-hint]
leader_hint(known_leader_id) MUST return the leader's node ID when known,
or a sentinel (u64::MAX) when unknown. The hint is best-effort — it MAY
be stale after a leader change.

r[follower-redirect.hint-freshness]
is_hint_fresh(hint_term, current_term) MUST return true when hint_term ==
current_term. A hint from a prior term MUST be considered stale. Clients
receiving a stale hint MUST retry discovery.

r[follower-redirect.leader-accepts]
should_accept_request(state) MUST return true if and only if state ==
Leader. Only the leader processes client requests directly.

## Configuration Change

r[config-change.is-valid-phase]
is_valid_phase MUST return true if and only if phase is STABLE (0) or
JOINT (1). All transitions MUST preserve validity.

r[config-change.can-start]
can_start_config_change MUST return true if and only if current_phase is
STABLE AND new_config_size > 0. A change MUST NOT start during the joint
phase. An empty new config MUST be rejected.

r[config-change.enter-joint]
enter_joint MUST return PHASE_JOINT. Requires current_phase == STABLE.

r[config-change.leave-joint]
leave_joint MUST return PHASE_STABLE. Requires current_phase == JOINT.

r[config-change.is-joint-committed]
is_joint_committed MUST return true when commit_index >= joint_entry_index.

r[config-change.can-leave-joint]
can_leave_joint MUST return true when phase is JOINT AND the joint config
entry is committed.

r[config-change.config-for-quorum]
config_for_quorum MUST return QUORUM_JOINT for PHASE_JOINT, QUORUM_SINGLE
for PHASE_STABLE.

r[config-change.leader-in-new-config]
leader_in_new_config MUST return true if the leader's ID appears in the
new config member list.

r[config-change.should-step-down]
should_leader_step_down MUST return true when phase is STABLE, C_new is
committed, and the leader is NOT in the new config. The leader must step
down after completing a config change that removes it.

## Persistent State

r[persistent-state.vote-response]
must_persist_before_vote_response MUST return PERSIST_TERM | PERSIST_VOTED_FOR
when vote_granted is true (must persist term and votedFor before acking a
grant). MUST return PERSIST_TERM when vote is denied (persist updated term).

r[persistent-state.append-response]
must_persist_before_append_response MUST return PERSIST_LOG | PERSIST_TERM
when entries were appended (entries_appended true). MUST return PERSIST_TERM
when only the term changed (no new entries).

r[persistent-state.needs-persist]
needs_persist(persist_set, component) MUST return true when the component
bit is set in the persist_set bitmask. Components: PERSIST_TERM (1),
PERSIST_VOTED_FOR (2), PERSIST_LOG (4).

r[persistent-state.recover]
is_recovered_state_valid MUST check that recovered state is internally
consistent: term >= voted_term (cannot have voted in a future term).

r[persistent-state.vote-safety]
vote_safe_after_recovery MUST return true only when the recovered votedFor
for the given term allows voting. If the node already voted in this term
for a different candidate, it MUST return false.

r[persistent-state.term-recovery]
term_after_recovery MUST return the recovered term. The recovered term MUST
be >= any term seen before the crash.

## Fast Backtrack

r[fast-backtrack.conflict-hint]
conflict_hint MUST return the term and first index of the conflicting entry
from the follower's log. When the log is too short (no entry at prev_log_index),
MUST return conflict_term=0 and first_index=0 with the log length.

r[fast-backtrack.first-index-of-term]
first_index_of_term MUST scan backward from a starting position to find
the first entry with the given term. Used to build conflict hints.

r[fast-backtrack.fast-backtrack]
fast_backtrack MUST compute the new next_index using the conflict hint.
When the leader has entries with the conflicting term, next_index advances
to just past the leader's last entry for that term. When the leader has
no entry with the conflicting term, next_index jumps to the follower's
first_index_for_term. When the follower's log was too short,
next_index jumps to follower_log_length + 1.

r[fast-backtrack.leader-find-last]
leader_find_last_index_for_term MUST scan the leader's log to find the
last entry with the given term. Returns 0 when no entry with that term
exists.

## Client Routing

r[client-routing.route]
route_client_request MUST return ACCEPT for leaders, REDIRECT for
non-leaders with a known leader, and REJECT for non-leaders with no
known leader.

r[client-routing.should-accept]
should_accept MUST return true if and only if state == Leader.

r[client-routing.should-redirect]
should_redirect MUST return true when the node is not a leader and a
leader ID is known (leader_id != sentinel).

r[client-routing.leader-stale]
is_leader_stale MUST return true when the leader hint was learned in a
prior term (hint_term < current_term).

r[client-routing.route-read]
route_read_request MUST return ACCEPT_LOCAL for leaders, FORWARD for
non-leaders with a known leader (when follower reads are enabled),
and REJECT otherwise.

## Escrow

r[escrow.valid-state]
is_valid_state MUST return true for exactly: CREATED (0), FUNDED (1),
RELEASED (2), REFUNDED (3), DISPUTED (4). All transitions MUST
preserve validity.

r[escrow.terminal]
RELEASED and REFUNDED MUST be terminal — no outgoing transitions.
Terminal states MUST block all transitions.

r[escrow.transition]
Valid transitions: Created→Funded, Funded→Released, Funded→Refunded,
Funded→Disputed, Disputed→Released, Disputed→Refunded. All other
transitions MUST be rejected. Created has exactly one outgoing edge.
Funded has three. Disputed has two (both terminal).

r[escrow.fund]
fund MUST debit the buyer and transition to FUNDED. Requires state ==
CREATED, amount > 0, and buyer has sufficient funds. The buyer's new
balance MUST equal old - amount. Fund-then-refund MUST return the buyer
to the original balance.

r[escrow.release]
release MUST credit the seller and transition to RELEASED. Requires
state == FUNDED or DISPUTED, amount > 0, and seller balance won't
overflow. The seller's new balance MUST equal old + amount.

r[escrow.refund]
refund MUST credit the buyer and transition to REFUNDED. Requires
state == FUNDED or DISPUTED, amount > 0, and buyer balance won't
overflow. The buyer's new balance MUST equal old + amount.

r[escrow.dispute]
dispute MUST transition FUNDED to DISPUTED. All other states MUST
reject. Dispute is a state-only operation — no balance changes.

r[escrow.conservation]
Total value (buyer + seller + escrow) MUST be constant across all
operations. Fund-then-release preserves the three-party total.
Fund-then-refund preserves the three-party total. Fund-dispute-release
and fund-dispute-refund also preserve totals.

## Fee Computation

r[fee.compute]
compute_fee MUST return floor(amount * rate_bps / 10000). Fee MUST be
bounded: 0 <= fee <= amount. Zero amount yields zero fee. Zero rate
yields zero fee. Full rate (10000 bps) takes the entire amount. Fee
MUST be monotonic in both amount and rate.

r[fee.net]
compute_net MUST return amount - fee. Net MUST be non-negative. Zero
rate means net equals amount. Full rate means net equals zero.

r[fee.conservation]
fee + net MUST equal amount for all valid inputs. Value is neither
created nor destroyed by fee computation.

r[fee.valid-rate]
is_valid_rate MUST return true if and only if rate_bps <= 10000.

r[fee.split]
split_with_fee MUST return (fee, net) where fee + net = amount. Split
conservation MUST hold for all valid rates.

r[fee.tiered]
tiered_fee MUST return max(proportional_fee, min_fee) capped at amount.
When proportional exceeds min, use proportional. When min exceeds
proportional but not amount, use min. When min exceeds amount, use
amount. Tiered fee MUST never exceed amount. When amount >= min_fee,
the tiered fee MUST be >= min_fee.

## Cross-Module: Financial

r[properties.escrow-fund-uses-debit]
Escrow fund_buyer_after_spec(buyer, amount) MUST equal
balance::debit_spec(buyer, amount). Escrow funding is a balance debit.

r[properties.escrow-release-uses-credit]
Escrow release_seller_after_spec(seller, amount) MUST equal
balance::credit_spec(seller, amount). Escrow release is a balance credit.

r[properties.escrow-terminal-like-process]
Escrow is_terminal mirrors process_state::is_terminal — both define
absorbing states with no outgoing transitions.

r[properties.fee-conservation-matches-transfer]
For a valid fee split, fee + net = amount mirrors transfer conservation
(sender + receiver = total). Fee computation preserves value.

r[properties.fee-zero-rate-identity]
compute_net(amount, 0) MUST equal amount, matching the identity
property of zero-amount transfers.

## Multi-Account Ledger

r[ledger.total]
total_balance MUST return the sum of all account balances. Empty ledger
total MUST be zero. Single-account total MUST equal that balance. Sum
MUST be non-negative. Returns None on overflow.

r[ledger.balance-at]
balance_at MUST return the balance at the given account index.

r[ledger.account-count]
account_count MUST return the number of accounts in the ledger.

r[ledger.can-transfer]
can_transfer MUST return true if and only if: both indices are in range,
indices differ (no self-transfer), amount > 0, sender has sufficient funds,
and receiver won't overflow. Self-transfer MUST always be rejected. Zero
amount MUST always be rejected.

r[ledger.transfer-result]
ledger_transfer MUST return (new_sender, new_receiver) where sender is
debited by amount and receiver is credited by amount. The ledger length
MUST be preserved. Only the sender and receiver accounts change — all
others MUST be identical to the original.

r[ledger.conservation]
After any valid transfer, the sum of all account balances MUST equal the
sum before the transfer. Two successive valid transfers MUST preserve the
total. A transfer with fee (sender pays amount, receiver gets amount - fee,
fee collector gets fee) also MUST preserve the total.

r[ledger.transfer-with-fee]
ledger_transfer_with_fee MUST debit sender by amount, credit receiver by
amount - fee, and credit fee collector by fee. All three indices MUST be
distinct. Fee MUST be <= amount. The total across all accounts MUST be
preserved.

r[ledger.batch]
apply_transfers applies a sequence of transfers in order. When all
transfers are valid (all_transfers_valid), the batch MUST preserve the
total balance. The batch MUST preserve ledger length.

## Cross-Module: Ledger

r[properties.ledger-transfer-uses-balance]
Ledger transfer sender result MUST equal balance::debit_spec and receiver
result MUST equal balance::credit_spec. The ledger composes balance
operations.

r[properties.ledger-conservation-is-double-entry]
A ledger transfer debiting and crediting the same amount is a balanced
entry in the double_entry sense: is_balanced_spec(seq![amount], seq![amount]).

## Settlement and Netting

r[settlement.int-sum]
int_sum_spec MUST compute the recursive sum of a Seq<int>. Sum of empty
is zero. Sum of all-zeros is zero.

r[settlement.obligation-valid]
An obligation is valid when both party indices are in range, distinct,
and amount > 0. Swapping sender and receiver negates both parties'
positions.

r[settlement.all-valid]
all_obligations_valid MUST check every obligation in the sequence against
obligation_valid.

r[settlement.apply-obligation]
apply_obligation MUST debit the sender and credit the receiver in the
position vector. The operation MUST preserve the sum of positions.

r[settlement.compute-positions]
compute_positions MUST compute net positions by applying all obligations
to an all-zeros vector. The result length MUST equal num_parties. Empty
obligations produce all-zero positions.

r[settlement.positions-sum-zero]
Net positions MUST always sum to zero. This is the fundamental conservation
theorem: each obligation contributes +amount to one party and -amount to
another. Single obligations also sum to zero.

r[settlement.valid-settlement]
A settlement is valid when it produces the same net positions as the
original obligations. The original is always a valid settlement of
itself. A valid settlement preserves every party's net position.

r[settlement.obligation-count]
obligation_count MUST return the number of obligations.

r[settlement.net-position-at]
net_position_at MUST return the net position for a single party.

r[settlement.apply-preserves-sum]
Applying one obligation preserves the sum of positions. By induction,
applying all obligations preserves the sum.

r[settlement.apply-preserves-length]
Applying obligations preserves the position vector length.

r[settlement.self-settlement]
Every set of obligations is a valid settlement of itself (reflexivity).

## Verification Frontier

r[verification-frontier.contract-implication]
Contract implication admission MUST classify a callee precondition under finite caller facts, path facts, and type-bound facts as Proven, Rejected, or Unknown. Proven MUST mean the modeled facts cover the precondition and MAY be used as check-elision evidence inside the finite model. Rejected MUST expose deterministic violation metadata or a directly false precondition. Unknown MUST remain non-proof evidence.

r[verification-frontier.type-bound-facts]
Type-bound fact extraction MUST expose deterministic range facts for modeled boolean, unsigned integer, and signed integer domains. The extracted facts MUST use named domain constants, distinguish signed from unsigned domains, and compose with caller-provided ranges without widening a stricter caller bound.

r[verification-frontier.slice-access-certificate]
Slice-access certificate admission MUST accept only finite certificates proving the slice range is within the backing length and every fixed or bounded dynamic offset lies inside that slice. Inverted ranges, out-of-backing ranges, out-of-slice offsets, and unbounded dynamic offsets MUST be rejected or classified as Unknown rather than accepted.

r[verification-frontier.arena-scope-provenance]
Arena scope-provenance admission MUST track arenas, allocations, allocator wrappers, and containers by scope depth or explicit untracked provenance. A deeper local-scope value MUST NOT escape by return across a shallower boundary or be stored into a shallower-lived destination, while untracked heap-backed values MUST NOT be treated as arena-tainted without an explicit provenance fact.

r[verification-frontier.progress-budget]
Progress-budget admission MUST classify finite task/control-flow summaries using named operation-cost constants and named budget values. Admission MUST be Proven only when every modeled acyclic path reaches yield or return within budget and no modeled cycle can avoid yield or return indefinitely; over-budget paths and no-yield cycles MUST be rejected with deterministic metadata.

r[verification-frontier.external-reference-boundary]
Documentation and evidence for Lattice/Salt-inspired verification-frontier primitives MUST label Lattice/Salt as an external design reference only. Trellis MUST NOT treat Lattice code, benchmarks, or solver behavior as trusted validation, and every Trellis claim MUST be backed by repo-local specs, proofs, tests, Tracey coverage, or validation logs.

r[verification-frontier.outcome-invariant-bundle]
Verification-frontier admission helpers MUST expose reusable invariant facts for public admission outcomes. For every public admission family, Proven MUST imply the modeled safety predicate for that family, Unknown MUST remain non-proof evidence, and Rejected MUST NOT be accepted as proof or check-elision evidence.

r[verification-frontier.metadata-stability]
Verification-frontier admission helpers MUST use stable named reason codes and deterministic evidence fields for Rejected and Unknown outcomes. Evidence fields MUST be derived from modeled inputs or named constants and MUST NOT depend on external benchmarks, wall-clock time, process state, or solver behavior outside the Trellis proof surface.

## Verification Gap Inventory

16 total trusted/weakened/runtime-only proof-gap boundaries remain: 16
`#[verifier::external_body]` sites, 0 `assume_specification[...]` bridges, and
0 instruction-selection runtime-only public API exemptions. No
`@verified-logic:no-ensures` markers remain.

### Permanent trust boundaries (16 items)
These remain by design or because the current abstraction boundary is the
point of the model, not a proof target.

- 4 legacy cryptographic hash axioms / exec bridges in `chain.rs` and
  `snapshot_integrity.rs`; equal-input determinism now follows directly from
  pure spec equality.
- 1 version-comparison bridge in `nix_version.rs`; the recursive `cv_fuel`
  proof lemmas are now internalized, leaving only the exec/spec connection
  trusted.
- 10 UCAN codec/signature bridges in `ucan_did.rs` and `ucan_signature.rs`;
  `ucan_cid.rs` now reuses the shared DID base58btc contract for CID multibase
  round-trip instead of carrying a separate CID axiom, and public DID decode now
  composes verified prefix, base58, varint, and key-suffix primitives around the
  remaining base58btc contract.
- 1 web-of-trust crypto bridge in `web_of_trust_principal.rs`; attestation and
  revocation signature-input construction and comparison are now verified from
  canonical bytes.

### Closeable proof-gap boundaries (0 items)
The former instruction-selection runtime-only public API exemptions now have
direct implementation and verification-test coverage for their well-formedness,
matching, tiling, coverage, soundness, projection, evaluation, and validity
contracts.

These are tracked individually in `openspec/specs/verification-gaps/spec.md`.

## WAL Segment

r[wal-segment.is-contiguous]
is_contiguous(prev_seq, current_seq) MUST return true if and only if
current_seq == prev_seq + 1. WAL entries MUST have consecutive sequence
numbers with no gaps. prev_seq MUST be less than u64::MAX.

r[wal-segment.space-remaining]
space_remaining(written, capacity) MUST return capacity - written when
written <= capacity, 0 otherwise. When written == 0, remaining MUST
equal capacity. When written == capacity, remaining MUST be 0.

r[wal-segment.entry-fits]
entry_fits(written, entry_size, capacity) MUST return true if and only if
written + entry_size <= capacity (using saturating addition to avoid
overflow). A zero-size entry always fits when written <= capacity. An
entry larger than the full capacity MUST NOT fit.

r[wal-segment.should-rotate]
should_rotate(written, capacity) MUST return true when written >= capacity.
A full segment MUST trigger rotation. An empty segment (written == 0) with
nonzero capacity MUST NOT trigger rotation.

r[wal-segment.write-advance]
write_advance(written, entry_size) MUST return written + entry_size, or
None on overflow. The result MUST be > written when entry_size > 0. The
result MUST equal written when entry_size == 0.

r[wal-segment.truncate-safe]
is_truncate_safe(truncate_to, committed_seq, applied_seq) MUST return true
if and only if truncate_to <= committed_seq AND truncate_to <= applied_seq.
Truncation MUST NOT discard committed-but-unapplied entries nor unapplied
entries. Truncating to 0 MUST always be safe.

r[wal-segment.replay-count]
replay_count(checkpoint_seq, end_seq) MUST return end_seq - checkpoint_seq
when end_seq >= checkpoint_seq, 0 otherwise. This is the number of entries
to replay during crash recovery. Replay from the same point MUST yield 0.

r[wal-segment.checkpoint-valid]
is_checkpoint_valid(checkpoint_seq, committed_seq) MUST return true if and
only if checkpoint_seq <= committed_seq. A checkpoint MUST NOT advance past
the committed sequence number.

## Cross-Module: WAL Segment

r[properties.wal-advance-is-monotonic]
write_advance(written, entry_size) when defined MUST satisfy
monotonic::is_advance(written, result). WAL write position is monotonic.

r[properties.wal-replay-is-saturating-sub]
replay_count(checkpoint, end) MUST equal
arithmetic::saturating_sub_spec(end, checkpoint). Replay count is a
saturating subtraction.

r[properties.wal-truncate-uses-min]
is_truncate_safe(t, c, a) MUST equal (t <= ordering::min_spec(c, a)).
Truncation safety is a comparison against the minimum of committed and
applied sequence numbers.

r[properties.wal-contiguous-is-strict-advance]
If is_contiguous(prev, current), then monotonic::is_strict_advance(prev,
current) holds. Contiguous WAL entries form a strictly advancing sequence.

## B-tree Balance

r[btree-balance.fill-pct]
fill_pct(count, capacity) MUST return count * 100 / capacity (integer
percentage). fill_pct MUST be 0 when count is 0 and 100 when count
equals capacity. capacity MUST be nonzero.

r[btree-balance.is-underfull]
is_underfull(count, capacity) MUST return true when count < capacity / 2.
A node with fewer than half its capacity is underfull. capacity MUST be
>= 2.

r[btree-balance.is-overfull]
is_overfull(count, capacity) MUST return true when count > capacity. A
node exceeding its capacity MUST be split.

r[btree-balance.should-split]
should_split(count, capacity) MUST return true if and only if count >
capacity. Splitting is required when the node exceeds its maximum.

r[btree-balance.should-merge]
should_merge(count, sibling_count, capacity) MUST return true when
count + sibling_count <= capacity. Two underfull nodes that together fit
in one node MUST be merged. count + sibling_count MUST NOT overflow.

r[btree-balance.split-point]
split_point(count) MUST return count / 2. The split divides the node
into two halves. split_point MUST be >= 1 when count >= 2.

r[btree-balance.split-left-size]
split_left_size(count) MUST return split_point(count). The left node
takes the first half.

r[btree-balance.split-right-size]
split_right_size(count) MUST return count - split_point(count). The
right node takes the remainder. left_size + right_size MUST equal count.

r[btree-balance.min-keys]
min_keys(capacity) MUST return capacity / 2. This is the minimum key
count for a non-root internal node (the B-tree invariant). capacity
MUST be >= 2.

r[btree-balance.can-borrow]
can_borrow(sibling_count, capacity) MUST return true when sibling_count >
min_keys(capacity). The sibling has keys to spare for redistribution.

## Cross-Module: B-tree Balance

r[properties.btree-split-conserves]
split_left_size(n) + split_right_size(n) MUST equal n for all n. No keys
are lost or created during a split.

r[properties.btree-fill-bounded]
fill_pct(count, capacity) MUST be in [0, 100] for count <= capacity.
The fill percentage is always a valid percentage.

r[properties.btree-min-keys-is-underfull-threshold]
is_underfull(min_keys(cap), cap) MUST be false. A node at exactly the
minimum key count is NOT underfull.

## LSM Level

r[lsm-level.target-size]
level_target_size(level, base_size, size_ratio) MUST return
base_size * size_ratio^level, saturating at u64::MAX. Level 0 MUST
return base_size. size_ratio MUST be >= 2. base_size MUST be > 0.

r[lsm-level.needs-compaction]
needs_compaction(level_size, target_size) MUST return true when
level_size > target_size. A level exceeding its target MUST trigger
compaction. An empty level MUST NOT need compaction.

r[lsm-level.space-amp-pct]
space_amp_pct(total_size, live_size) MUST return total_size * 100 /
live_size when live_size > 0. This is the space amplification as a
percentage. 100 means no amplification (total == live). live_size
MUST be nonzero.

r[lsm-level.write-amp-per-level]
write_amp_per_level(size_ratio) MUST return size_ratio. Each level
compaction rewrites approximately size_ratio times the data.

r[lsm-level.total-write-amp]
total_write_amp(num_levels, size_ratio) MUST return num_levels *
size_ratio, saturating at u64::MAX. Total write amplification is
the sum across levels.

r[lsm-level.level-count]
level_count_for_size(total_size, base_size, size_ratio) MUST return
the minimum number of levels k such that base_size * size_ratio^k >=
total_size. Returns 0 when total_size <= base_size. base_size > 0
and size_ratio >= 2.

r[lsm-level.size-ratio-valid]
is_valid_size_ratio(ratio) MUST return true if and only if ratio >= 2.
A ratio below 2 degenerates the LSM structure.

## Cross-Module: LSM Level

r[properties.lsm-target-monotonic]
If level_a <= level_b, level_target_size(level_a, base, ratio) MUST be <=
level_target_size(level_b, base, ratio). Higher levels have equal or
larger targets.

r[properties.lsm-space-amp-ge-100]
space_amp_pct(total, live) MUST be >= 100 when total >= live. Space
amplification is always at least 100%.

r[properties.lsm-write-amp-is-checked-mul]
total_write_amp(levels, ratio) MUST agree with
arithmetic::checked_mul_spec(levels, ratio) in the non-overflow case.

## Cross-Module: Financial Accounting (Extended)

r[properties.escrow-fund-refund-identity]
Funding an escrow then refunding MUST return the buyer to the original
balance. fund-then-refund is the identity on buyer balance.

r[properties.fee-split-agrees]
split_with_fee(amount, rate_bps) MUST return the same (fee, net)
as calling compute_fee and compute_net individually.

r[properties.simple-entry-is-balanced]
A double-entry with equal positive debit and credit amounts MUST be a
simple entry: is_simple_entry(amount, amount) is true when amount > 0.

r[properties.ledger-transfer-needs-funds]
If can_transfer returns true, the source account MUST have balance >=
amount. Transfers are only possible with sufficient funds.

## Cross-Module: Raft Consensus Pipeline

r[properties.election-win-implies-quorum]
Winning an election (has_won_election) MUST imply the vote count
reaches quorum (is_quorum). Election victory requires majority.

r[properties.heartbeat-resets-follower-timer]
A heartbeat from the current leader in the current term MUST trigger
an election timer reset.

## Cross-Module: Lock ↔ Lease ↔ Expiration

r[properties.lock-expired-matches-general-expired]
is_lock_expired(deadline, now) MUST equal is_expired(deadline, now).
Lock expiration is a special case of general expiration.

r[properties.lock-deadline-saturates]
compute_lock_deadline(acquired_at, ttl_ms) MUST be >= acquired_at.
On overflow, the deadline saturates to u64::MAX (never goes backward).

## Cross-Module: Drain ↔ Node Lifecycle

r[properties.draining-blocks-operations]
can_start_op(true) MUST return false. Draining blocks all new
operations regardless of node lifecycle status.

r[properties.operational-allows-non-drain-ops]
An operational node (online or degraded) that is not draining MUST
allow new operations via can_start_op(false).

## Cross-Module: Retry ↔ Circuit Breaker

r[properties.exhausted-means-no-retry]
When attempts are exhausted (is_exhausted), should_retry MUST return
false even if the error is retryable.

r[properties.open-circuit-blocks-requests]
An open circuit breaker MUST block all requests via allow_request.

r[properties.closed-circuit-allows-requests]
A closed circuit breaker MUST allow all requests via allow_request.

## Cross-Module: CAS ↔ Fencing ↔ Distributed Lock

r[properties.fencing-token-monotonic]
compute_next_fencing_token(Some(prev)) MUST return a value strictly
greater than prev, ensuring monotonic token advancement.

r[properties.valid-write-excludes-stale]
A valid write (is_valid_write) MUST NOT be stale (is_stale). These
predicates are mutually exclusive.

## Cross-Module: Vector Clock ↔ CRDT

r[properties.vc-merge-dominates-both]
After merging two vector clocks, each input clock's entries MUST be
<= the corresponding entry in the merged result.

r[properties.vc-merge-equals-gcounter-merge]
Vector clock merge and G-Counter merge MUST produce identical results
(both are pointwise max).

## Cross-Module: Noop Commit ↔ Log

r[properties.noop-roundtrip]
A noop entry constructed via make_noop_entry MUST be recognized as a
noop by is_noop.

r[properties.noop-commit-index-is-new-tail]
The noop commit index for a log of length n MUST be n+1 (the 1-based
position where the noop lands after append).

## Cross-Module: Snapshot Transfer ↔ Chunk

r[properties.first-chunk-zero-offset]
Offset zero MUST be identified as the first chunk.

r[properties.single-chunk-transfer]
A transfer where chunk_size == total MUST have offset=0 be both the
first and last chunk.

## Cross-Module: Concurrency Wave 5

r[properties.mpmc-occupancy-matches-mpsc]
bounded_mpmc occupancy (tail - head) MUST equal mpsc_bounds queue_occupancy
(total_sent - total_received) when given equivalent inputs.

r[properties.work-stealing-occupancy-matches-mpmc]
work_stealing deque_size (bottom - top) MUST equal bounded_mpmc occupancy
(tail - head) when given equivalent inputs.

r[properties.spin-completed-implies-cas-no-retry]
When spin_backoff is_completed, a CAS loop that respects the backoff MUST
stop retrying (attempts exhausted).

r[properties.seqlock-write-needs-release]
A seqlock write protocol requires at least Release memory ordering for
the store that ends the write.

r[properties.seqlock-read-needs-acquire]
A seqlock read protocol requires at least Acquire memory ordering for
the load that begins the read.

r[properties.rcu-grace-matches-epoch-advance]
For epochs 0 and 1, RCU grace period advance MUST produce the same result
as epoch_reclaim next_epoch (both return epoch + 1). They diverge at
epoch 2 where epoch_reclaim wraps to 0.

r[properties.ref-count-zero-implies-reclaimable]
When ref_count should_deallocate (strong_count == 0) and the address is
not protected by any hazard pointer, the address MUST be reclaimable.

r[properties.lock-ordering-prevents-ticket-deadlock]
When two threads acquire ticket locks in lock_ordering order, the
would_deadlock predicate MUST be false for the second acquisition.

r[properties.barrier-all-arrived-is-quorum]
When all threads arrive at a barrier (arrived == expected), the number
of arrivals MUST satisfy the quorum majority threshold.

r[properties.futex-notify-enables-consume]
After futex notify, the notified state MUST allow consume_notification
to return to idle.

r[properties.mpsc-drained-implies-mpmc-empty]
An MPSC channel that is drained (closed + empty) MUST also register as
empty in the bounded_mpmc model.

r[properties.cas-idempotent-needs-no-aba]
An idempotent CAS update (desired == current) always succeeds, making
ABA generation tracking unnecessary.

r[properties.ticket-lock-release-reduces-waiters]
Releasing a ticket lock MUST reduce the waiter count by exactly one.

## Paxos

r[paxos.ballot-gt]
ballot_gt MUST return true if and only if ballot a is strictly greater
than ballot b in lexicographic (round, proposer_id) order. The relation
MUST be irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetric. Trichotomy MUST hold:
exactly one of gt(a,b), eq(a,b), gt(b,a) is true for any pair.

r[paxos.ballot-eq]
ballot_eq MUST return true if and only if both round and proposer_id match.

r[paxos.ballot-ge]
ballot_ge MUST return true if and only if a is greater than or equal to b.
The relation MUST be reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric.

r[paxos.can-promise]
can_promise MUST return true if and only if the ballot is strictly greater
than the acceptor's current promised ballot. After promising ballot b,
the acceptor MUST reject any ballot strictly less than b.

r[paxos.promise-next]
promise_next MUST update the promised ballot to the new ballot and
preserve the accepted value. The new promised ballot MUST be strictly
greater than the previous one.

r[paxos.can-accept]
can_accept MUST return true if and only if the ballot is at least as
high as the acceptor's current promised ballot. Acceptance of the same
ballot MUST be idempotent. Accepting a ballot MUST not block any higher
ballot from being accepted later.

r[paxos.accept-next]
accept_next MUST record the ballot and value, setting has_accepted to
true. Both the promised and accepted ballots MUST equal the acceptance
ballot. The accepted value MUST equal the provided value.

r[paxos.pick-value]
pick_value MUST return the accepted value when one exists, and the
proposer's own value otherwise.

r[paxos.higher-accepted]
higher_accepted MUST return the value associated with the higher
accepted ballot when comparing two promise responses. When neither
has accepted, it MUST return own_value. When exactly one has accepted,
it MUST return that value.

## QuePaxa

r[consensus.quepaxa.boundary]
QuePaxa primitives MUST model only finite deterministic crash-stop safety/admission facts and MUST reject overclaims for real network liveness, probabilistic termination, random-number quality, benchmark results, production SMR behavior, adaptive MAB optimality, or Byzantine fault tolerance.

r[consensus.quepaxa.proposal-order]
QuePaxa proposal helpers MUST expose named constants for nil proposals, phase roles, initial round, phase count, and reserved leader priority; proposal ordering MUST be deterministic by priority, proposer identity, and value identity; reserved leader priority MUST be admitted only for the declared leader in the initial round.

r[consensus.quepaxa.isr]
QuePaxa interval summary register helpers MUST preserve same-step first values, aggregate same-step proposals by deterministic maximum, return the previous aggregate on immediate step advance, discard stale updates without changing state, and return nil for skipped-step prior aggregates.

r[consensus.quepaxa.tcast]
QuePaxa propagation admission MUST require quorum facts for existent, common, and universal proposal summaries and MUST establish the modeled universal subset common subset existent relationship.

r[consensus.quepaxa.abstract-round]
QuePaxa abstract round helpers MUST admit decisions only when the slot is not already decided, a proposed value is known, and the best existent and universal proposals match; divergent best proposals MUST carry forward the best common proposal instead of deciding.

r[consensus.quepaxa.concrete-phases]
QuePaxa concrete phase helpers MUST admit only named phases, prevent recorder catch-up from moving a proposer backward, allow catch-up to a higher recorder step with the recorder first value, and expose a phase-2 decision only when it refines the abstract decision guard.

r[consensus.quepaxa.fast-path]
QuePaxa fast-path helpers MUST admit only an initial-round declared-leader reserved-priority proposal first at quorum with a unique reserved priority and an abstract guard; non-leader, non-initial-round, missing-quorum, or non-unique reserved-priority attempts MUST be rejected.

r[consensus.quepaxa.hedging]
QuePaxa hedging admission MUST require non-decreasing activation delays, leader-first zero-delay placement when a leader is configured, and more scheduled proposers than the crash-fault budget, without claiming real-time recovery or probabilistic liveness.

r[consensus.quepaxa.fixtures]
QuePaxa validation MUST include positive and negative tests for boundary overclaims, proposal ordering, reserved leader priority, ISR transitions, propagation quorums, abstract decisions, concrete phase/catch-up guards, fast-path admission, and hedging schedules.

## Lease Mutex

r[lease-mutex.is-available]
is_available MUST return true if and only if the current time is at or
past the lock's lease expiry.

r[lease-mutex.can-acquire]
can_acquire MUST return true only when the lock is available, the TTL
is positive, the new expiry will not overflow, and the fence token can
be incremented.

r[lease-mutex.try-acquire]
try_acquire MUST succeed only when can_acquire holds. On success, it
MUST set the holder, compute expiry as now + ttl, and increment the
fence token by exactly one.

r[lease-mutex.is-owner]
is_owner MUST return true only when the requester matches the holder
AND the lease has not expired (now < expiry).

r[lease-mutex.write-permitted]
write_permitted MUST return true only when the requester is the current
owner AND the request's fence token is at least as high as the lock's.

r[lease-mutex.release]
release MUST set the expiry to now, immediately terminating the lease.
The fence token MUST be preserved on release. After release, the lock
MUST be available and the former holder MUST NOT be the owner.

r[lease-mutex.safety]
If is_owner returns true for node A at time t, then is_owner MUST
return false for any different node B at the same time t (mutual
exclusion). Successive leases MUST NOT overlap: if acquisition happens
at or after the old expiry, no point in time falls in both validity
windows. A previous holder's writes MUST be rejected after a new
acquisition due to the incremented fence token.

## Two-Phase Locking

r[two-phase-lock.valid-phase]
is_valid_phase MUST return true only for GROWING and SHRINKING.

r[two-phase-lock.can-acquire]
can_acquire MUST return true only in the growing phase.

r[two-phase-lock.after-acquire]
after_acquire MUST increment the held count by one and keep the phase
as GROWING. The phase MUST remain GROWING after any acquisition.

r[two-phase-lock.can-release]
can_release MUST return true only when held count is greater than zero.

r[two-phase-lock.after-release]
after_release MUST decrement the held count by one and set the phase
to SHRINKING.

r[two-phase-lock.phase-monotonic]
Once the phase transitions to SHRINKING, it MUST never return to
GROWING. Acquiring in the SHRINKING phase MUST be detected as a
violation and rejected.

r[two-phase-lock.is-complete]
is_complete MUST return true if and only if held count is zero and the
phase is SHRINKING. After acquiring, the transaction MUST NOT be
complete. Releasing the last lock MUST make the transaction complete.

r[two-phase-lock.would-violate]
would_violate MUST return true if and only if the operation is an
acquire in the shrinking phase. This is the only 2PL violation.

r[two-phase-lock.transition]
transition MUST apply one lock operation and return the new state, or
None if the operation is invalid. Valid transitions MUST preserve phase
validity. A balanced lifecycle (n acquires followed by n releases)
MUST end in the complete state.

## Serialization Injectivity

r[serialize-inj.encode-u64]
encode_u64 MUST produce an 8-byte little-endian encoding of a u64 value.
The encoding MUST be injective: equal byte sequences imply equal values.

r[serialize-inj.decode-u64]
decode_u64 MUST recover the original u64 from an 8-byte little-endian
encoding. decode(encode(v)) MUST equal v for all v.

r[serialize-inj.encode-u64-length]

Different tag bytes MUST produce different encodings for all payload
combinations.

r[serialize-inj.encode-len-prefixed]
encode_len_prefixed MUST prepend an 8-byte little-endian length header
to the data. The encoding MUST be injective.

r[serialize-inj.encode-pair]
encode_pair MUST concatenate two fixed-width u64 encodings into exactly
16 bytes. The encoding MUST be injective: equal byte sequences imply
equal field values.

r[serialize-inj.encode-quad]
encode_quad MUST concatenate four fixed-width u64 encodings into exactly
32 bytes. The encoding MUST be injective: equal byte sequences imply all
four fields are pairwise equal.

r[serialize-inj.chain-hash-compose]
The composition of encode_quad injectivity with chain hash collision
resistance MUST prove that equal chain hashes imply equal (prev, index,
term, data_id) fields.

r[serialize-inj.dual-hash-compose]
The composition of encode_pair injectivity with dual hash collision
resistance MUST prove that equal dual hashes imply equal (a, b) fields.

r[properties.chain-hash-implies-field-equality]
Chain hash equality MUST imply all four fields (prev, index, term, data_id)
are pairwise equal. This composes collision resistance with encoding
injectivity.

r[properties.dual-hash-implies-field-equality]
Dual hash equality MUST imply both fields (a, b) are equal. This composes
collision resistance with encoding injectivity.

r[properties.quad-encoding-matches-chain-layout]
Quad encoding MUST produce exactly 32 bytes for all inputs, matching the
chain hash field layout.

## Typed State

r[typed-state.stamp]
stamp MUST wrap raw data as Stamped<Unverified, T> preserving the
inner value. stamp(v).inner() MUST equal v.

r[typed-state.verify]
verify_with MUST transition from Unverified to Verified if and only if
the predicate returns true. It MUST return None when the predicate fails.

r[typed-state.unwrap]
unwrap_verified MUST extract the inner value from Stamped<Verified, T>.
It MUST only accept verified data.

r[typed-state.roundtrip]
stamp then verify_with(true predicate) then unwrap_verified MUST return
the original value.

r[typed-state.predicate-holds]
If verify_with returns Some, the predicate MUST have returned true for
the inner value.

r[typed-state.inner]
inner MUST give read access to the wrapped value regardless of state.

r[properties.snapshot-typed-verify]
verify_snapshot composing typed_state with snapshot_integrity MUST
return Some if and only if verify_integrity holds for the inner data.

## Job Retry

r[job-retry.is-retryable]
is_retryable_error MUST return true for error codes in [100, 200)
(transient failures). Error codes in [0, 100) are permanent failures
(non-retryable). Error codes >= 200 are unknown (non-retryable).

r[job-retry.attempts-remaining]
attempts_remaining MUST return max_attempts - attempts when attempts
< max_attempts, and 0 otherwise. The result MUST never be negative.

r[job-retry.cooldown-elapsed]
is_cooldown_elapsed MUST return true when now >= last_attempt_time +
cooldown_ms, using saturating addition to prevent overflow.

r[job-retry.should-retry]
should_retry MUST return true only when the error is retryable AND
attempts < max_attempts AND cooldown has elapsed. All three conditions
MUST hold.

r[job-retry.next-attempt]

counter MUST never exceed max_attempts.

## Job Timeout

is_timed_out MUST return true when now >= deadline. Once timed out,
MUST stay timed out for all future time values (monotonic).

r[job-timeout.time-remaining]
time_remaining MUST return deadline - now when now < deadline, and 0
when now >= deadline. The result MUST never be negative.

r[job-timeout.elapsed-time]
elapsed_time MUST return now - start_time when now >= start_time,
and 0 otherwise.

r[job-timeout.extend-deadline]
extend_deadline MUST return min(deadline + grace, deadline +
max_extension) using saturating addition. The result MUST be >=
deadline (extensions only push forward). The result MUST NOT exceed
deadline + max_extension.

## Job Result

r[job-result.exit-code-classification]
Exit code classification MUST be mutually exclusive and exhaustive:
is_success_code (== 0), is_failure_code (1-127), is_error_code (>= 128).
Exactly one MUST return true for any u8 input.

r[job-result.output-hash-matches]
output_hash_matches MUST return true if and only if the computed hash
equals the expected hash.

r[job-result.output-size-valid]
output_size_valid MUST return true if and only if
min_size <= actual_size <= max_size.

r[job-result.validate-result]
validate_result MUST check exit code, then output hash, then output
size, returning the first failing criterion: 0=all pass, 1=bad exit,
2=bad hash, 3=bad size. MUST return 0 if and only if all criteria pass.

## Durable Execution

r[durable-execution.history-valid]
history_valid MUST return true if and only if durable execution events
form one contiguous append-only history: valid event kinds only,
sequence numbers starting at 0 and increasing by 1, and no event after a
durable terminal outcome.

r[durable-execution.prefix]
durable_prefix_len MUST return the largest prefix length with contiguous
sequence numbers and no post-terminal append. A gap, duplicate sequence
number, invalid event kind, or event after a terminal outcome MUST stop
the prefix at the first invalid position.

r[durable-execution.checkpoint-advance]
advance_checkpoint MUST never move backward. For a valid checkpoint
(old_checkpoint <= durable_prefix_len), it MUST advance to the durable
prefix. If the caller gives an already-invalid checkpoint beyond the
prefix, advance_checkpoint MAY leave it unchanged.

r[durable-execution.checkpoint-prefix]
A valid checkpoint MUST NOT claim durability past the contiguous durable
prefix. Checkpoint advancement MUST stop at the first gap and MUST NOT
skip missing prior steps.

r[durable-execution.replayable-event]
replayable_event_at MUST return Some(event) if and only if the index is
strictly within the durable prefix. Reads at or beyond the durable prefix
MUST return None.

r[durable-execution.effect-dedup]
should_execute_effect(seq_num, effect_id) MUST return false when the
durable prefix already contains a matching effect-completion marker for
that same (seq_num, effect_id) pair. Different effect ids MUST remain
independent.

r[durable-execution.resume-step]
resume_step MUST return Some(step) for the first step not yet covered by
the durable checkpoint / contiguous durable prefix. If durable history
already fixes a terminal outcome, resume_step MUST return None.

r[durable-execution.resume-bounds]
When resume_step returns Some(step), step MUST be at least the current
valid checkpoint and at most the contiguous durable prefix. Recovery MUST
NOT rewind below a valid checkpoint and MUST NOT skip over the first
missing durable step.

r[durable-execution.terminal]
is_terminal_execution MUST return true if and only if the valid durable
prefix ends in a terminal event (completed, failed, or cancelled).
Appending any later non-terminal event MUST be rejected by the append
rule.

r[durable-execution.terminal-recovery]
recovered_status MUST return the durable terminal outcome when one
exists, and None otherwise. Recovery of a terminal history MUST replay
that status rather than reopening the run.

## Cross-Module: Job Execution

r[properties.retry-non-retryable-never-retries]
should_retry with a non-retryable error code MUST always return false,
regardless of attempt count or cooldown.

r[properties.timeout-triggers-failure]
is_timed_out returning true for a RUNNING job means the job should
transition to FAILED (job_state::is_valid_transition(RUNNING, FAILED)).

r[properties.result-success-completes]
validate_result returning VALID (0) for a RUNNING job means the job
should transition to COMPLETED.

r[properties.result-failure-fails]
validate_result returning non-zero for a RUNNING job means the job
should transition to FAILED.

r[properties.retryable-disjoint-from-success]
Exit code 0 (success) MUST NOT be in the retryable error range [100,200).
Success and retryable errors are disjoint categories.

r[properties.durable-effect-uses-idempotency]
If durable replay suppresses an effect because a matching completion
marker already exists, then job_idempotency duplicate-prevention intuition
must agree: a consumed token for that same effect id would also reject a
fresh execution attempt.

r[properties.durable-history-seq-is-strict-advance]
Adjacent sequence numbers in a valid durable history MUST satisfy
monotonic::is_strict_advance after integer widening. Durable append-only
histories strictly advance their sequence numbers.

r[properties.durable-history-prefix-like-journal]
An allowed durable-history append MUST preserve the same strictly
increasing sequence-number shape used by journal-style append-only logs.
Durable history prefix growth is journal-like.

## Consensus Fast Path

r[consensus.fast-path.boundary]
Fast-path work MUST stay a finite crash-fault arithmetic, certificate, order,
conflict, recovery, convergence, and history proof surface. External protocol,
model-checking, benchmark, and capability overclaims MUST reject.

r[consensus.fast-path.quorum]
Named formulas over a fault budget MUST derive cluster size, majority, fast
quorum, recovery support, and failure tolerance. Valid inputs MUST give a
fast/recovery-majority intersection of at least the support threshold.

r[consensus.fast-path.certificate]
Certificates MUST have unique replica acknowledgements, one command, one
same-view cohort, equal acceleration and base views at commit, the fast
quorum, and every active proposer promise. Mixed or incomplete inputs reject.

r[consensus.fast-path.base-order]
Receive-to-propose, propose-to-log, and log-to-execute preservation MUST
compose into the execution-order promise. Reordering bases MUST move or reject
the fast acknowledgement boundary.

r[consensus.fast-path.conflict]
Non-conflict MUST preserve final state and each command's response under
both orders. Conservative classifiers MUST treat unknown effects as
conflicting; a false-negative witness MUST reject refinement.

r[consensus.fast-path.recovery]
Recovery MUST carry the accepted set across coordinator failure and MUST
admit normal new-view commands only after the recovery or no-op marker
commits. Recovered commands MUST precede conflicting new-view work.

r[consensus.fast-path.dual-path]
Fast and original convergence MUST apply one operation once and return the
cached response while the dedup record remains retained and identities match.

r[consensus.fast-path.linearization]
A conflicting later invocation MUST NOT execute before a validly responded
fast-committed operation. An adjacent non-conflicting swap MUST preserve state
and responses only under the application commutativity contract.

Positive and negative fixtures MUST cover both replica profiles, certificate
gates, ordering capabilities, conflict classes, recovery transitions,
convergence identities, and history boundaries.

Every exported theorem MUST bind its requirement, proof function, source,
verifier, assumptions, tests, and non-claims before archive.

r[consensus.fast-path.non-claims]

application classifier soundness, network liveness, storage durability,
dynamic membership, Byzantine tolerance, transactions, performance, or whole-
system linearizability.

can_commit_at_spec holds for the new index with the leader's term.

r[consensus-path.follower-commit-monotonic-bounded]
follower_update_commit_spec MUST return a value >= current_commit
(monotonic) and <= leader_commit (bounded by leader).

r[consensus-path.applied-bounded-by-commit]
advance_last_applied_spec MUST return a value <= commit_index and
>= last_applied. No entry is applied before it is committed.

r[consensus-path.write-path-end-to-end]
The write path composes: append preserves invariant, the new entry is
committable, and applied entries stay within commit bounds.

r[consensus-path.lease-subsumes-read-index]
lease_read_safe_spec returning true MUST imply read_safe_at_spec also
returns true. Lease reads are strictly stronger than ReadIndex.

r[consensus-path.committed-read-consistent]
If two servers have matching log prefixes through the commit point and
a read is safe, both servers agree on every entry below read_index.

r[consensus-path.read-path-end-to-end]
Authority confirmation + matching prefix through commit MUST imply
every entry below read_index agrees on both servers.

singleton sequences MUST always be sorted.

r[btree-insert.find-position]

to maintain sortedness. The position MUST be in [0, keys.len()]. All keys
before it MUST be <= key.

Length MUST decrease by 1. Deleting from a sorted sequence MUST produce
a sorted sequence.

r[btree-delete.merge-nodes]
merge_nodes MUST concatenate two sorted sequences where all keys in left
< all keys in right. The result MUST be sorted and have length
left.len() + right.len().

r[btree-delete.borrow-left]
borrow_left MUST take the last key from the left sibling and prepend it
to the node. Combined count MUST be unchanged.

r[btree-delete.borrow-right]
borrow_right MUST take the first key from the right sibling and append it
to the node. Combined count MUST be unchanged.
A committed write at index N is visible to any subsequent read with
read_index > N, provided logs match through the commit point.

## Concurrent Data Structure Composition

When all threads are RCU-quiescent AND all hazard slots are empty,
every retired address MUST be reclaimable under both protocols.

r[concurrent-composition.2pl-shrinking-no-acquire]
In the shrinking phase, no acquisition MUST be permitted regardless of
lock ordering.

Remaining capacity plus occupancy MUST equal total capacity.

## Counting Semaphore

r[semaphore.can-acquire]
can_acquire MUST return true if and only if `permits <= available`.
Zero permits MUST always be acquirable.

r[semaphore.after-acquire]
after_acquire MUST return `available - permits`. Acquiring a positive
number of permits MUST strictly decrease the available count.
Acquiring zero permits MUST be identity. Chained acquisitions
MUST equal a single combined acquisition of the sum.

r[semaphore.after-release]
after_release MUST return `available + permits`. Releasing a positive
number of permits MUST strictly increase the available count.
Releasing zero permits MUST be identity. The result MUST NOT exceed
capacity when the release is valid. Chained releases MUST equal
a single combined release of the sum.

r[semaphore.is-full]
is_full MUST return true if and only if `available == capacity`.
A full semaphore MUST have zero acquired permits.

## Zircon Kernel Primitives

r[zircon-rights.attenuation]
A derived handle MUST NOT gain rights not present on the source handle.
Attenuation MUST be subset-preserving. Duplicate and replace MUST accept
same-rights or reduced-rights requests and reject expanded-rights requests.

r[zircon-rights.operation-gates]
Handle operations MUST require the matching handle right: duplicate,
transfer, wait, signal, and signal-peer each need their corresponding bit.

r[zircon-handle.identity]
Every live object MUST have a stable koid. Duplicate, replace, transfer,
and receive MUST preserve the referenced koid.

r[zircon-handle.ownership]
A handle MUST be in exactly one ownership state: bound, in-transit, or
closed. Send moves a bound handle to in-transit. Receive rebinds an
in-transit handle to a process. Close moves any handle to closed.

r[zircon-handle.lifetime]
An object MUST remain live while any bound or in-transit handle refers to
it. If no live handles remain, the object is no longer live.

r[zircon-wait.readiness]
A Zircon wait MUST be ready exactly when observed_signals & requested_mask
is non-zero.

r[zircon-wait.wait-set]
A multi-handle wait MUST report ready exactly for entries whose observed
and requested signal masks intersect.

Events MUST carry only user-signal bits. Setting and clearing user signals
MUST affect only those bits and MUST be idempotent.

r[zircon-event.peer-closed]
Eventpairs MUST derive PEER_CLOSED from peer handle liveness: when the
peer is not live, PEER_CLOSED is asserted; when the peer remains live,
it is not asserted from handle state alone.

r[zircon-channel.datagram]
Channels MUST behave as datagram queues: each write appends one whole
message and each read consumes one whole message. Empty queues are not
readable.

r[zircon-channel.transfer]
Sending handles through a channel MUST preserve koid and rights while
changing ownership from bound to in-transit. Receiving MUST preserve koid
and rights while rebinding the handle to the destination process.

r[zircon-channel.discard]
Closing a destination endpoint with unread queued handle-bearing messages
MUST discard those messages and close their transferred handles.

r[zircon-channel.signals]
A channel endpoint MUST assert READABLE when its receive queue is non-empty
and PEER_CLOSED when the peer endpoint is gone.

r[zircon-futex.wait-compare]
A futex wait MUST block only when observed == expected. Mismatched values
MUST leave the waiter count unchanged.

r[zircon-futex.wake-bound]
A futex wake MUST release at most the requested count and never more than
existing waiters. Waking an empty futex MUST be a no-op.

r[zircon-futex.requeue]
A futex requeue MUST wake up to the requested wake count, move up to the
requested requeue count, and conserve total blocked waiters except those
explicitly woken.

r[zircon-socket.stream]
Sockets MUST behave as paired byte streams: writes append bytes to the
peer receive buffer, reads consume bytes in order, short writes respect
free capacity, and short reads return available bytes.

r[zircon-socket.disposition]
Each socket endpoint MUST independently track write-disabled state.
Local disable MUST reject writes and assert WRITE_DISABLED. The peer MUST
observe PEER_WRITE_DISABLED. Existing buffered data MUST remain readable.

r[zircon-socket.thresholds]
Sockets MUST support read and write threshold signals. Threshold 0 disables
that signal. Read-threshold readiness depends on queued bytes; write-
threshold readiness depends on free space.

r[zircon-socket.peer-closed]
Closing all handles to one socket endpoint MUST assert PEER_CLOSED on the
opposite endpoint.

r[zircon-port.async-wait]
An async wait registration MUST bind (koid, mask, key, mode) to a port.
When observed signals intersect the registered mask, delivery MUST enqueue
an async packet with that key and observed mask.

r[zircon-port.one-shot]
A one-shot async wait registration MUST be consumed after first delivery.
A repeating registration MUST remain active after delivery.

r[zircon-port.user-queue]
A port MUST accept explicitly queued user packets and deliver them in FIFO
order relative to other user-queued packets.

r[zircon-timer.lifecycle]
Timers MUST support set, cancel, reset, and deadline passage. When an
armed timer reaches its deadline it becomes signaled. The signaled state
MUST persist until cancel or reset.

r[zircon-fifo.element-aligned]
FIFOs MUST transfer whole fixed-size elements only. Accepted writes are
bounded by free element slots. Reads return whole queued elements in FIFO
order.

r[zircon-fifo.peer-closed]
Closing all handles to one FIFO endpoint MUST assert PEER_CLOSED on the
opposite endpoint.

r[zircon-fifo.signals]
A FIFO endpoint MUST assert READABLE when its receive queue is non-empty
and WRITABLE when free element slots remain.

r[zircon-job.containment]
Jobs MUST form a tree with at most one parent per non-root job. Each
process MUST belong to exactly one owning job.

r[zircon-job.kill-propagation]
Killing a job MUST cover the whole subtree: every descendant job and every
process owned by jobs in that subtree is included in the kill set.

r[zircon-job.critical-process]
A critical process exiting with a non-zero code MUST kill its owning job.
A clean exit or non-critical process MUST NOT trigger job kill.

r[zircon-job.parent-lifetime]
A job MUST stay live when any running process exists in its subtree, even
if the parent job itself has no direct handles.

r[properties.zircon-rights-handle]
Handle duplication/refinement properties MUST connect Zircon rights
attenuation to handle-local koid and rights preservation.

r[properties.zircon-signal-refinement]
Zircon event, channel, socket, and FIFO signal computations MUST refine
bitmask facts expressible in the generic signal algebra.

r[properties.zircon-channel-lifetime]
Channel transfer MUST preserve the lifetime rule that an object remains
live while a bound or in-transit handle exists.

r[properties.zircon-port-wait]
Async port delivery MUST correspond to a satisfied Zircon wait-readiness
predicate for the registered mask.

r[properties.zircon-timer-deadline]
If deadline A is earlier than or equal to deadline B and time has passed B,
then time has also passed A. Timer signaling order MUST respect deadline
ordering.

r[properties.zircon-job-process-state]
A process covered by job-kill propagation MUST admit the abstract
Running -> Terminated process-state transition.

r[properties.zircon-futex-process-state]
Any waiter released by futex wake or requeue MUST admit the abstract
Blocked -> Ready process-state transition.

## BEAM Primitives

r[beam-process.lifecycle]
A BEAM process MUST move only forward through `alive -> exiting -> dead`.
Once dead, it MUST remain dead.

r[beam-process.isolation]
BEAM processes with distinct pid identities MUST have distinct logical heap
identities. Mutating one process heap MUST NOT mutate any other process
heap. Inter-process term transfer MUST occur by copying.

r[beam-mailbox.ordering]
A BEAM mailbox MUST append new messages at the tail. Messages from the same
sender MUST remain in send order.

r[beam-mailbox.selective-receive]
Selective receive MUST scan from the saved cursor and return the first
matching message. Unmatched messages MUST remain in mailbox order.

r[beam-mailbox.save-offset]
When selective receive finds a match, the save offset MUST reset to 0.
When no match exists, the save offset MUST advance to the mailbox end so
already-scanned non-matches are not re-scanned.

r[beam-send.async]
BEAM send MUST always succeed from the sender's point of view. Sending to a
live process MUST append to its mailbox; sending to a dead process MUST
silently drop the message.

r[beam-link.symmetry]
Process links MUST be symmetric. Creating a link MUST add both directions,
and unlinking MUST remove both directions.

r[beam-link.propagation]
An abnormal exit received through a live link MUST cause a non-trapping
alive peer to begin exiting. A normal exit MUST NOT cascade.

r[beam-link.trap-exit]
A process with `trap_exit` enabled MUST convert incoming exit signals into
`EXIT` mailbox messages, except `kill`, which MUST terminate the process as
`killed`.

r[beam-monitor.unidirectional]
A monitor MUST be unidirectional: monitor creation MUST produce only
watcher-owned monitor state, leave the target process state unchanged, and
route any DOWN observation only through the watcher-side result/mailbox
path.

r[beam-monitor.down]
An active monitor MUST deliver exactly one `DOWN` message when the target
dies, and then become inactive.

r[beam-monitor.late]
Creating a monitor for an already-dead process MUST immediately yield a
`DOWN` message with reason `noproc`.

r[beam-monitor.demonitor]
Demonitor MUST disable future DOWN delivery. Demonitor with flush MUST
remove any queued DOWN for the monitor reference.

r[beam-scheduler.preemption]
Reduction charging MUST saturate at zero remaining budget. Zero remaining
budget, or explicit yield, MUST trigger preemption.

r[beam-scheduler.priority]
Scheduler priority selection MUST prefer `max` over `high`, `high` over
`normal`, and `normal` over `low`, subject to starvation-prevention for
lower queues. Only alive processes with work are runnable.

r[beam-registry.uniqueness]
The BEAM registry MUST remain bijective: no two entries may share a name,
and no two entries may share a pid.

r[beam-registry.cleanup]
Cleaning up a dead pid MUST remove any registry entry for that pid so the
name can be registered again.

## Cross-Module: BEAM Primitives

r[properties.beam-death-links]
A process death propagated through BEAM links MUST respect link rules:
non-trapping peers begin exiting on abnormal signals, trapped peers receive
EXIT messages, and unlinked peers observe nothing.

r[properties.beam-death-monitor]
A monitored process death MUST produce exactly one DOWN message for each
active monitor reference.

r[properties.beam-death-mailbox]
Sending to a dead BEAM process MUST leave its mailbox unchanged.

r[properties.beam-death-registry]
Cleaning up a dead BEAM pid in the registry MUST remove that pid's entry so
a register-then-cleanup roundtrip restores the prior registry and the same
name can be registered again.

r[properties.beam-scheduler-state]
The scheduler MUST treat only alive processes with pending work as runnable.

## Control Flow Graph

r[control-flow-graph.valid-program]
CFG construction MUST reject branch and conditional-branch targets that are
out of range or that target instruction 0. The entry block model assumes no
internal predecessor to the first instruction.

r[control-flow-graph.leader]
Leader identification MUST mark instruction 0, every branch target, and every
instruction immediately following a terminator as a basic-block leader.

r[control-flow-graph.partition]
Basic block construction MUST produce non-empty half-open ranges that cover the
instruction stream contiguously from 0 to N. Adjacent blocks MUST meet exactly
at a boundary, with no gaps or overlaps.

r[control-flow-graph.edges]
CFG edges MUST follow the terminator of each basic block: normal instructions
fall through to the next block, unconditional branches jump only to their
unique target block, conditional branches jump to the target and fall through
when distinct, and returns produce no successors.

r[control-flow-graph.entry]
A non-empty CFG MUST expose block 0 as its entry block.

r[control-flow-graph.exit]
A block MUST be classified as an exit block if and only if its final
instruction is a return.

r[control-flow-graph.well-formed]
A well-formed CFG MUST have a valid instruction stream and edge endpoints that
all refer to existing basic blocks.

r[control-flow-graph.reachability]
Reachability analysis MUST mark exactly the blocks reachable from entry block 0,
and dead-block detection MUST return exactly the complement set.

## Dominator Tree

r[dominator-tree.valid-graph]
Dominator analysis MUST reject edges whose endpoints fall outside the CFG node
range.

r[dominator-tree.entry-dominates]
The entry node MUST dominate every reachable node.

Every reachable non-entry node MUST have exactly one immediate dominator.

r[dominator-tree.tree-structure]
Immediate-dominator links MUST form a parent-pointer tree rooted at the entry.

The iterative dominator algorithm MUST converge to the same dominator sets and
immediate-dominator map as the path-based definition.

r[dominator-tree.dominance-frontier]
A node MUST appear in another node's dominance frontier exactly when one of its
predecessors is dominated by that node but the node does not strictly dominate
the join point itself.

## Liveness Analysis

r[liveness.convergence]
Backward liveness analysis MUST start from empty live sets and reach a fixed
point within 2 × V × B synchronous rounds for V variables and B blocks. Each
round MUST be monotonic: no live bit may flip from true back to false.

r[liveness.equations]
At a fixed point, live-out MUST equal the union of successor live-in rows, and
live-in MUST equal use ∪ (live-out \ def) for every block.

r[liveness.use-def]
A variable MUST be live-in at a block if and only if there exists a path from
that block to a block that uses the variable before any intervening block on
that path defines it.

r[liveness.connected]
If a def-free witness path explains why a variable is live-in at a block, then
that variable's projected live range MUST include every block on that witness
path.

r[liveness.def-kills]
If a block defines a variable and does not use it before that definition, the
variable MUST NOT be live-in to that block.

r[liveness.exit]
A block with no CFG successors MUST have empty live-out. Return values, if any,
MUST be modeled as local uses of the exit block rather than as post-exit
liveness.

## Register Allocation

r[regalloc.interference]
The register-allocation core MUST build a symmetric interference graph with no
self-loops where two variables interfere exactly when their caller-supplied live
ranges overlap at some program point.

r[regalloc.coloring]
Any accepted allocation MUST assign distinct physical registers to interfering
variables, and every register assignment MUST use a register ID strictly less
than `k`.

r[regalloc.completeness]
Every variable MUST receive exactly one allocation outcome: either a physical
register or a spill slot. In this core model, spilled variables MUST use spill
slot `variable_index`.

r[regalloc.spill-fallback]
The greedy allocator MUST process variables in increasing variable-index order,
choose the lowest available register in `0 .. k-1`, and spill only when every
register in that range conflicts with an interfering earlier variable.

## WebAssembly MVP Primitives

r[wasm-value.types]
Core Wasm values MUST carry exact value-type information. A value tagged `i32`,
`i64`, `f32`, or `f64` MUST be accepted only when that exact type is required.

r[wasm-stack.discipline]
The modeled `i32.add` instruction MUST consume exactly two `i32` operands from
the operand-stack suffix and MUST produce exactly one `i32` result.

r[wasm-locals.access]
`local.get`, `local.set`, and `local.tee` MUST access only in-bounds local
indices and MUST preserve the declared type of each local slot.

r[wasm-memory.bounds]
A memory load or store MUST succeed only when every addressed byte lies within
linear-memory bounds. Out-of-bounds access MUST fail without modifying memory.

r[wasm-memory.grow]
`memory.grow` MUST increase linear memory only in whole 64KiB pages. On
success, old memory contents MUST remain unchanged as a prefix of the grown
memory and the appended bytes MUST be zero. On failure, memory MUST remain
unchanged.

r[wasm-control.labels]
Wasm control labels MUST distinguish function, block, and loop targets. Branch
target arity MUST use result types for function and block labels, and parameter
types for loop labels.

r[wasm-control.branch-arity]
A modeled branch MUST be admitted only when its depth names an in-bounds control
label and the operand-stack suffix exactly matches the target label types. Depth
0 MUST name the innermost label.

r[wasm-control.return-arity]
A modeled return MUST be admitted only when the control stack has a root
function label and the operand-stack suffix exactly matches that function
label's result types. Empty control stacks or non-function roots MUST be
rejected.

r[wasm-validation.unreachable-stack]
The Wasm validation model MUST track operand types, control labels, and current
reachability. Reachable input-pop checks MUST require an exact operand-type
suffix match, while unreachable input-pop checks MUST be admitted without that
suffix.

r[wasm-validation.i32-add]
The Wasm validation model MUST admit `i32.add` only when reachable state has two
trailing `i32` operand types, or when the current path is unreachable. On
success, validation MUST record one produced `i32` result type.

r[wasm-validation.control-transfer]
The Wasm validation model MUST validate `br` and `return` against the existing
control-label arity rules while the current path is reachable. Successful `br`,
`return`, and `unreachable` validation MUST mark the current path unreachable.
Malformed branch depths, missing function roots, and reachable suffix mismatches
MUST be rejected.

r[wasm-validation.control-frame]
The Wasm validation model MUST record structured control frames with label kind,
parameter types, result types, entry operand-stack height, and entry
reachability. Helpers that enter or end modeled blocks and loops MUST keep the
control-frame stack aligned with the branch-label stack.

r[wasm-validation.block-entry]
The Wasm validation model MUST admit block and loop entry only when reachable
state has a matching parameter suffix, or when the current path is unreachable.
Successful entry MUST remove consumed parameter types, push an aligned control
frame and branch label, and keep reachability unchanged.

r[wasm-validation.block-end]
The Wasm validation model MUST admit ending the innermost frame only when
reachable state has a result-type suffix matching that frame, or when the current
path is unreachable. Successful end MUST pop the frame and aligned label,
restore the operand-type stack to the frame entry height, append the frame result
types, and restore reachability to the frame's entry reachability.

r[wasm-table.signature]
The Wasm table model MUST represent a finite sequence of optional function
signatures. A table entry MUST be admitted for indirect-call use only when the
selected index is in bounds, initialized, and its parameter and result type
sequences exactly match the expected function type.

r[wasm-validation.call-indirect]
The Wasm validation model MUST admit modeled `call_indirect` only when
table-entry signature admission succeeds and, while reachable, the operand-type
stack suffix exactly matches the expected function parameters followed by an
`i32` table-index operand. Successful reachable validation MUST consume that
suffix and push the expected result types. Successful unreachable validation MUST
keep operand pops stack-polymorphic but still require a matching table entry and
synthesize the expected result types.

r[wasm-validation.br-table]
The Wasm validation model MUST admit modeled `br_table` only when the default
branch depth is in bounds, every listed branch depth is in bounds, every listed
target's branch-label types exactly match the default target's branch-label
types, and, while reachable, the operand-type stack suffix exactly matches the
default target types followed by an `i32` selector. Successful validation MUST
mark the current path unreachable. Unreachable validation MUST keep operand pops
stack-polymorphic but still reject malformed depths or mismatched target types.

## WebAssembly Runtime Bounds

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.model]
The runtime-bound model MUST use finite owned states, explicit host-observation
transition facts, and closed running, finished, trapped, paused, and fuel
outcomes. Admission MUST reject out-of-range or duplicate transition keys.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.fuel]
Fuel consumption MUST subtract the exact admitted amount. Insufficient fuel and
zero-budget execution MUST not underflow or change the starting state.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.segmentation]
For one admitted deterministic model and one unchanged observation sequence,
prefix-plus-suffix execution MUST match one run with the combined budget.
Terminal and explicit host-pause boundaries MUST absorb the unused suffix.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.continuation]
A continuation MUST bind exact generation, artifact, profile, input, context,
and host-observation identities. Resume MUST reject any mismatch without
changing the continuation, and it MUST retain the pause or fuel reason.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.allocation]
Page allocation MUST be monotone, capped, and initialization-only. Invalid
state, arithmetic overflow, capacity exhaustion, or a closed phase MUST return
an explicit error without changing the supplied allocator state.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.streaming]
A chunk schedule MUST be an exact ordered partition of its declared byte range.
Admission MUST reject ambiguous empty input, zero lengths, gaps, overlap,
reordering, arithmetic overflow, extra ranges, and trailing or missing bytes.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.growth-policy]
A memory-growth profile MUST explicitly allow or deny `memory.grow`. Denial
MUST preserve memory, while admission MUST delegate only to the existing
checked whole-page growth primitive and preserve its success and failure laws.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.evidence]
Public runtime-bound decisions MUST have requirement links, positive and
negative tests, and direct Verus proof artifacts for their declared finite
laws.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.non-claims]
Runtime-bound evidence MUST remain scoped to finite abstract laws. It MUST NOT
claim concrete interpreter, unsafe allocator, host scheduler, serialization,
migration, sandbox, certification, or downstream adapter correctness.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.docs]
The component MUST have public exports, module guidance, requirement links,
proof evidence, and explicit consumer revalidation guidance.

r[wasm-runtime-bounds.final-validation]
Closeout MUST include focused tests, full-library Verus verification, Tracey
coverage, Cairn gates, accepted-spec synchronization, and archive evidence.

## Loop Detection

r[loop.back-edge]
A CFG edge MUST be classified as a back edge if and only if its target
block dominates its source block.

r[loop.body]
Given a CFG, a reachability bitmap, and a dominance matrix for the same graph,
loop-body detection MUST return exactly the seeded backward closure for (B -> H):
start from {H, B}, then repeatedly add any reachable block dominated by H whose
successor is already in the current body, excluding H as an interior successor
for non-self loops. Randomized tests SHOULD match this closure against the
path-based natural-loop oracle for reachable non-self back edges.

r[loop.header-dominance]
Every reachable block in a detected non-self loop body MUST be dominated by
that loop's header.

r[loop.single-entry]
Given a reachability bitmap for the CFG entry and a detected non-self loop
body, single-entry checking MUST return true if and only if every reachable edge
entering the body from outside targets the header. Reachable non-header side
entries are not allowed.

r[loop.nesting]
If one detected loop is nested in another, the inner loop body MUST be a strict
subset of the outer loop body and the inner header MUST be contained in the
outer body.

r[loop.nesting-forest]
Loop-nesting parents MUST form an acyclic forest of strict-body-superset links:
any recorded parent of a loop MUST strictly contain that loop's body.

r[loop.exits]
Loop-exit detection MUST return exactly the CFG edges whose source is inside a
loop body and whose destination is outside that body.

## SSA Construction

r[ssa.single-assignment]
SSA construction MUST assign a fresh version to every phi definition and every
instruction definition, with no two explicit definitions sharing the same
version.

r[ssa.dominance-of-uses]
Every SSA use MUST be dominated by the definition of its version: instruction
uses by a dominating phi or earlier instruction definition, and phi arguments
by a definition that dominates the end of the predecessor edge they reference.

r[ssa.phi-placement]
Phi placement MUST insert a phi for variable V at exactly the blocks in the
iterated dominance frontier of V's definition set. Each placed phi MUST contain
exactly one argument slot per distinct predecessor block.

r[ssa.phi-semantics]
A phi node MUST select the version associated with the predecessor edge that was
actually taken.

r[ssa.destruction]
Phi elimination MUST replace each block's phi nodes with parallel copies on each
incoming edge so that executing the eliminated program along any CFG path
produces the same versioned environment as executing the SSA program.

r[ssa.idf-convergence]
Iterated dominance frontier computation MUST grow monotonically from the empty
set and reach a fixed point within at most N rounds for an N-block CFG.

## Dead Code Elimination

r[dce.side-effect]
Dead-code classification MUST treat raw opcodes `>= 128` as conservatively
effectful, with `128` = Store, `129` = Call, and `130` = Return.

r[dce.criterion]
An instruction MUST be classified as dead if and only if it has no side effect,
defines a variable, and that definition is not live-out at the instruction's
program point. Instructions without a definition MUST remain conservatively
live in this initial model.

r[dce.side-effect-never-dead]
An instruction with a side effect MUST never be classified as dead, regardless
of its live-out row.

r[dce.live-def-never-dead]
An instruction that defines a variable that is live-out MUST never be
classified as dead.

r[dce.no-live-removed]
Dead-code elimination MUST preserve every instruction whose output is live at
its program point or that has a side effect. Removing dead instructions MUST
preserve block count and CFG edges.

r[dce.semantics]
Under the raw IR's current straight-line block-order execution model, dead-code
elimination MUST preserve the observable trace of stores, calls, and returns on
any input environment compatible with the chosen live-out rows.

r[dce.retained-identical]
If two executions agree on a kept instruction's entry-live variables, that
instruction MUST emit the same observable event and produce the same live-out
values in both executions.

r[dce.removed-no-effect]
A removed dead instruction MUST emit no observable event and MUST preserve the
values of all variables that remain live after that instruction.

r[dce.idempotent]
A second elimination pass on the result of DCE MUST keep every instruction,
producing the same output as the first pass.

## Constant Folding

r[constfold.lattice]
Constant propagation MUST use a three-valued lattice with `Top`, `Const(c)`,
and `Bottom`, ordered so `Bottom <= Const(c) <= Top` and incomparable
constants meet at `Bottom`. The lattice meet MUST be commutative,
associative, and idempotent, with `Top` as identity and `Bottom` as
absorbing element.

r[constfold.finite-height]
The constant-propagation lattice MUST have height 2: there MUST NOT exist a
strict descending chain longer than `Top > Const(c) > Bottom`.

r[constfold.monotone]
Per-instruction transfer over the shared raw IR MUST be monotone under the
pointwise lattice order. `copy` MUST propagate an operand's current lattice
value. Supported binary ops MUST fold two constants, propagate `Bottom` if any
operand is `Bottom`, propagate `Top` when at least one operand is `Top` and no
operand is `Bottom`, and set malformed or unsupported definitions to
`Bottom`.

r[constfold.fold]
Compile-time folding MUST exactly match the modeled runtime semantics for the
supported raw opcodes: wrapping add/sub/mul, checked div-by-zero rejection,
bitwise and/or/xor, bounded shifts (`rhs < 64`), and comparisons encoded as
`0` or `1`.

r[constfold.convergence]
The current forward constant-propagation engine MUST process blocks in reverse
postorder, use the supplied entry environment for block 0, use pointwise meet
of predecessor out-environments for non-entry block inputs, and use a
conservative round budget of `2 × V × B + 1` for `V` variables and `B` blocks
while checking successive rounds for stability.

r[constfold.soundness]
For the current fixed-point soundness theorem, caller-supplied reachable entry
state MUST be modeled with a top-free entry environment: each entry slot is
`Const(c)` for an exact known value or `Bottom` for an unknown/overdefined
value, while `Top` is reserved for analysis-internal unreached rows. Along any
valid block path that starts at block `0` and does not later revisit block `0`,
every fixed-point `Const(c)` classification at block entry or block exit MUST
match the concrete value `c`, and `Bottom` MUST remain conservative.

## Instruction Selection

r[instruction-selection.well-formed-tree]
`is_well_formed_tree` MUST accept only expression trees whose node shapes match
the modeled operator contract and whose recursive `subtree_eval` succeeds:
constants have no children and a literal value, additions and multiplications
have exactly two children and no node literal, every child is well formed, and
checked arithmetic overflow makes the tree malformed for this surface.

r[instruction-selection.tiling-cost]
For a well-formed expression tree, `tiling_cost` MUST project the selected
`Tiling`'s `total_cost` without recomputing or mutating the tiling.

r[instruction-selection.subtree-eval]
`subtree_eval` MUST evaluate the modeled expression tree with checked `u64`
arithmetic: constants project their literal value, addition and multiplication
combine recursively evaluated operands, and malformed arity/value shapes or
arithmetic overflow return `None`.

r[instruction-selection.valid-tile-pattern]
`is_valid_tile_pattern` MUST reject a root wildcard tile, MUST accept wildcard
children as uncovered subtrees, and MUST recursively require every specific tile
node to satisfy the operator/literal/arity boundary: constants have no children
and a literal, while addition and multiplication have exactly two children and
no literal.

r[instruction-selection.tile-matches]
`tile_matches` MUST reject malformed trees and invalid tile patterns before
matching. For valid inputs it MUST return `None` when the root operator,
literal, or arity does not match; otherwise it MUST return uncovered roots in
preorder, using wildcard child patterns as uncovered subtree roots and recursing
through specific child patterns.

r[instruction-selection.optimal-tiling]
`optimal_tiling` MUST reject malformed trees and invalid tile lists, report the
lexicographically-first uncovered root when no complete tiling exists, and for
complete tilings choose the lowest total cost with deterministic tie-breaking by
tile rank and then tile index.

r[instruction-selection.coverage-check]
`check_coverage` MUST recompute each selection's covered paths, reject stale or
tampered selection coverage, reject duplicate coverage, and return true exactly
when the selected coverage is a sorted complete cover of the tree's node paths.

r[instruction-selection.soundness-check]
`check_soundness` MUST reject malformed trees and invalid tile lists, evaluate
the selected tiles according to their semantics with checked arithmetic, and
return true only when the selected tiling's value equals `subtree_eval` for the
whole tree.

## Stack Frame Layout

r[stack-frame.non-overlap]
Stack slot layouts MUST keep simultaneously-live locals or spills in disjoint
half-open byte ranges. Two locals or spills whose live ranges do not overlap MAY
reuse the same byte range.

r[stack-frame.alignment]
Every stack slot MUST start at an offset divisible by its declared alignment,
and every valid frame MUST keep the final frame size divisible by the stack
alignment.

r[stack-frame.frame-size]
The frame size MUST equal the stack-aligned rounding of the maximum slot end in
the layout. Invalid or misaligned slot inputs MUST be rejected instead of being
silently rounded.

r[stack-frame.growth]
Every slot end MUST lie within the computed frame boundary, and append-only slot
assignment MUST place each new slot at or after the current maximum slot
extent.

## Typed Configuration Normal Form

r[domain-primitives.typed-config.expression-envelope]

ordered declared dependency digests. This core MUST NOT compute a hash.

r[domain-primitives.typed-config.import-closure]
Imports MUST be static and frozen. Remote imports MUST not reach local, home, or
environment targets, and headers MUST forward only to same-origin relatives.

strict Clippy, repository checks, and Cairn lifecycle validation.

r[domain-primitives.typed-config.non-claims]

parsing, import execution, network or filesystem security, or hash correctness.

## Fenced Attempt Admission

linkage, count, and identity-relation facts. Unsupported variants MUST reject.

r[fenced-attempt-admission.refinement]

result linkage, report application, and next-epoch arithmetic MUST agree, and
applied reports MUST change only their named fields.

Reassignment MUST produce a strictly greater nonzero epoch and MUST reject at
the fixed-width maximum.

r[fenced-attempt-admission.event-idempotence]
A repeated event and payload identity MUST replay as a no-op. An event identity
with a different payload MUST reject as a conflict without merging either.

r[fenced-attempt-admission.terminal-closure]
Completed, failed, and superseded phases MUST reject every later
state-changing report unchanged.

r[fenced-attempt-admission.completion-linkage]

Each finite function, static, or shim item MUST have a unique key, compatible
concrete shape, bounded arguments, optional shim source, origin, and stability.

r[mono.collection]
Collection MUST equal deterministic finite reachability from declared roots
through references whose sources and targets are declared items.

r[mono.dedup]

## Rustc Metadata Identity

r[rustc-metadata.library-kind]
Rlib and dylib candidates MUST declare metadata and linkable code. Rmeta
candidates MUST declare metadata without claiming linkable object code.

r[rustc-metadata.identity-fields]
Compatibility MUST compare the declared crate name, compiler version, strict
version hash, and stable crate ID without changing rustc-mandated algorithms.

r[rustc-metadata.compatibility]
A candidate MUST satisfy artifact shape, request completeness, identity fields,
usage-mode linkability, and encoded-MIR requirements before admission.

r[rustc-metadata.admission]
Admission MUST return deterministic reason and candidate metadata for missing
fields, invalid capabilities, incompatibility, linkability, and encoded-MIR
failures.

r[rustc-metadata.dependency-loading]
Dependency selection MUST scan no more than `MAX_CANDIDATES` artifacts. It MUST
select one unique compatible candidate or report no match, ambiguity, or a bound
failure with deterministic candidate identities.

r[rustc-metadata.rmeta-pipelining]
Rmeta MAY satisfy check, documentation, pipeline, or compatible codegen metadata
use. Rmeta alone MUST NOT satisfy final linking.

r[rustc-metadata.evidence]
Positive and negative tests MUST cover all library kinds, identity mismatches,
encoded-MIR policy, rmeta boundaries, unique selection, no match, ambiguity, and
candidate bounds.

r[rustc-metadata.non-claims]
The finite model MUST NOT claim archive parsing, rustc hash construction or
collision resistance, linking, object code, LTO, compression, or whole-build
correctness.

## Track Caller ABI

r[track-caller.attribute-validity]
Tracked functions MUST use the Rust calling convention. They MUST NOT be
closures, naked functions, or unsupported item kinds.

r[track-caller.location-metadata]
Caller locations MUST use finite metadata that distinguishes definition sites,
call sites, and forwarded locations.

r[track-caller.direct-call]
A direct call to a tracked function MUST supply the location selected from its
explicit caller context. An untracked callee MUST NOT receive a hidden location.

r[track-caller.propagation]
A non-empty tracked-call chain MUST preserve the nearest untracked call-site
identity. Missing, changed, or excessive chain entries MUST fail admission.

r[track-caller.reify-shim]
A tracked function-pointer use MUST name a matching reify shim with a declared
definition-site fallback. An untracked function-pointer use MUST NOT add a shim.

Prototype, default-body, and local annotations MUST produce one deterministic
effective trait-method tracking result. Observed metadata MUST match that result.

r[track-caller.const-codegen-agreement]

r[track-caller.non-claims]
The finite metadata model MUST NOT claim stack walking, panic formatting,
runtime location allocation, ABI lowering, intrinsic behavior, debug-information
correctness, or whole-codegen correctness.

## Hypervisor Memslots

r[hypervisor-memslot.disjoint]
A memslot table MUST represent guest-frame-number (GFN) ranges as sorted,
non-overlapping half-open intervals `[base_gfn, base_gfn + npages)`. Adjacent
memslots MAY touch at a boundary, but no guest frame may belong to two
memslots at once.

r[hypervisor-memslot.lookup]
`lookup_memslot(slots, gfn)` MUST return the unique memslot whose guest-frame
range contains `gfn`, or `None` if no memslot contains it.

## Hypervisor GPA Translation

r[hypervisor-gpa.translate]
A successful GPA translation MUST preserve the byte offset inside the owning
memslot. The translated host address MUST be `host_base + (gfn - base_gfn)`
and MUST lie inside that memslot's host-backed region.

r[hypervisor-gpa.access]
GPA translation with access mode MUST distinguish at least three outcomes:
`Translated`, `Unmapped`, and `ReadonlyWrite`. A write into a readonly memslot
MUST return `ReadonlyWrite`. An address outside all memslots MUST return
`Unmapped`.

## Hypervisor Dirty Log

r[hypervisor-dirty-log.index]
The dirty-log bit index for a guest frame MUST be the frame's offset relative
to its memslot base: `dirty_index(base_gfn, gfn) == gfn - base_gfn`, and MUST
be in `[0, npages)` exactly when `gfn` belongs to the slot.

r[hypervisor-dirty-log.mark]
Marking a guest frame dirty MUST set exactly its relative dirty bit and leave
all other bits unchanged. Marking the same frame multiple times MUST be
idempotent.

r[hypervisor-dirty-log.union]
Merging dirty logs for the same memslot MUST behave as bitwise union. Clearing
a dirty log MUST reset all tracked bits to zero.

## Hypervisor vCPU State

r[hypervisor-vcpu.run-state]
A vCPU MUST be in exactly one of four abstract states: `Runnable`, `Halted`,
`Blocked`, or `Stopped`. `vcpu_can_enter_guest` MUST return true exactly in the
`Runnable` state. `Stopped` is terminal.

r[hypervisor-vcpu.halt-wakeup]
A halt from `Runnable` MUST move the vCPU to `Halted`. A deliverable wake event
MUST move a halted vCPU back to `Runnable`. Non-deliverable events leave the
state unchanged.

## Hypervisor Interrupts

r[hypervisor-interrupt.inject]
The pending virtual-interrupt structure MUST support enqueue-or-mark without
losing prior pending interrupts. Next-interrupt selection MUST be deterministic.
Re-marking an already pending interrupt MUST be idempotent.

r[hypervisor-interrupt.deliver]
A pending interrupt MUST be delivered only when the guest is interruptible.
Successful delivery MUST consume the selected pending interrupt. If the guest is
not interruptible, the pending set MUST remain unchanged.

## Hypervisor VM Exit

r[hypervisor-exit.classify]
VM-exit classification MUST map raw exit information into stable semantic
classes. The same raw input MUST always classify to the same class.

r[hypervisor-exit.disposition]
A semantic exit class MUST map to exactly one disposition: `ResumeGuest`,
`UserspaceHandle`, `Block`, or `Terminate`. IO/MMIO/Hypercall MUST map to
`UserspaceHandle`. Shutdown/InternalError MUST map to `Terminate`.

## Hypervisor Cross-Module Properties

r[properties.hypervisor-translation-region]
Every successful GPA translation MUST produce a host address contained in the
translated memslot's host-backed region.

r[properties.hypervisor-wakeup]
If a halted vCPU has a pending deliverable interrupt, wake evaluation MUST move
the vCPU to `Runnable`. If delivery is not permitted, the vCPU MUST remain
halted.

r[properties.hypervisor-exit-state]
Exit handling MUST preserve vCPU state consistency: `Block` leaves the vCPU
non-runnable, `Terminate` moves it to the terminal stopped state.

## Repository Index

r[repo-index.content-digest]
The repository index MUST compute a BLAKE3 digest from the raw bytes of each
tracked file and use that digest as the content identity key for the active
path view. If two tracked paths have identical bytes, their active path rows
MUST reference the same digest.

r[repo-index.persistent-store]
The repository index MUST persist committed path rows, extracted facts, and
stats in redb so a later process can reopen the database and answer queries
from the last successful refresh without reparsing tracked files first.

r[repo-index.atomic-refresh]
A repository-index refresh MUST publish at most one committed generation at a
time. Readers MUST observe either the prior committed generation or the newer
committed generation, never a mix. If a refresh fails before commit, the prior
committed generation MUST remain readable.

r[repo-index.incremental-refresh]
A repository-index refresh MUST update the active path view for added,
changed, unchanged, and deleted tracked files. When a tracked path keeps the
same digest and extractor kind across refreshes, the index MUST reuse the
stored extracted facts instead of reparsing the file.

r[repo-index.cross-reference]
The repository index MUST extract cross-reference facts needed for local repo
navigation: Rust items and `r[...]` reference sites from `src/**/*.rs`,
requirement definitions from `docs/requirements.md` and active OpenSpec
markdown, plus headings and active change/domain metadata from active
OpenSpec markdown.

r[repo-index.query]
The repository index MUST support deterministic local queries over committed
index state for `path`, `symbol`, `requirement`, `digest`, and `stats`.
Path queries MUST report the indexed facts for a tracked file. Requirement
queries MUST report the stored definition plus related implementation,
verification, dependency, or related reference sites.

## Web of Trust

r[web-of-trust.principal-fingerprint]
A principal identifier MUST be the full 32-byte BLAKE3 digest of the
principal's canonical public-key bytes. The same canonical bytes MUST always
produce the same identifier, and equality checks MUST use all 32 digest
bytes rather than a truncated prefix.

r[web-of-trust.principal-digest-admission]
Raw principal identifier digest bytes MUST be admitted as a `PrincipalId` only
when they are exactly 32 bytes long. Shorter or longer byte vectors MUST be
rejected before any principal-ID equality or chain logic treats them as
well-formed identifiers.

r[web-of-trust.attestation-signature]
An attestation signature MUST authenticate the issuer's canonical public-key
bytes, the subject's canonical public-key bytes, trust role, validity window,
and `sequence_no` exactly, using the canonical attestation payload-byte
grammar. Changing any signed field MUST invalidate the signature, and inputs
whose canonical byte-string fields exceed `u32::MAX` bytes MUST be rejected as
non-canonical.

r[web-of-trust.attestation-window]
An attestation MUST be active at time `t` iff its signature is valid, `t` is
inside the half-open window `[not_before, not_after)`, and no effective
revocation targets it at or before `t`.

r[web-of-trust.revocation]
A revocation record MUST be authenticated over its issuer, target reference,
and effective time using the canonical revocation payload-byte grammar.
Tampering with issuer, target reference, or effective time MUST invalidate
verification, and inputs whose canonical byte-string fields exceed `u32::MAX`
bytes MUST be rejected as non-canonical. A revocation record MUST be issued
by the same principal as the targeted attestation or targeted attestation
family. A revocation record MUST carry either an exact-payload target
reference or a family target reference. An exact-payload target identifies
attestation content by canonical attestation payload bytes; if multiple
records carry identical canonical attestation payload bytes, they are the same
exact-payload target and the revocation disables all such copies. A family
target MUST disable exactly the attestations in the named `(issuer, subject,
role)` family. Once effective, the revocation MUST remain effective for all
later times.

r[web-of-trust.chain-validity]
A trust chain MUST be valid only when every attestation in the chain is an
active `trust` edge at the evaluation time, the first issuer is a trust root,
each attestation's subject is the next attestation's issuer, and no principal
repeats in the chain.

r[web-of-trust.rooted-resolution]
For a fixed trust-root set `Roots` and fixed evaluation time `t`, a
rooted-trust decision for subject `S` under natural-number depth bound `d`
MUST return trusted iff either `S` is itself in `Roots` and the witness is the
empty chain, or there exists a valid trust chain at time `t` from some root in
`Roots` to `S` of length at most `d`.

r[properties.web-of-trust.revocation-cuts-trust]
For fixed trust roots and fixed evaluation times, if a successful
rooted-trust witness chain `C` for subject `S` includes attestation `A`, then
once `A` is effectively revoked, that same witness chain `C` MUST no longer
justify trust for `S` at later times. This requirement is witness-local and
does not forbid a different valid chain from still trusting `S`.

r[properties.web-of-trust.depth-monotone]
For a fixed trust-root set and fixed evaluation time, if a subject resolves as
trusted under depth bound `d`, then it MUST also resolve as trusted under
every depth bound `d' >= d`.

r[web-of-trust.threshold]
A threshold policy is parameterized by a natural `k`, an evaluation time `t`,
and a natural-number depth bound `d`. The policy MUST reject when `k = 0`.
For `k > 0`, it MUST accept subject `S` iff there exist at least `k` distinct
introducers `I` such that `d > 0`, `I` itself resolves as trusted at time `t`
under bound `d - 1`, `I` has an active direct trust edge to `S` at time `t`,
and appending that final direct edge yields a valid simple trust chain to `S`,
so repeated-principal final hops MUST NOT count. Multiple active attestations
from the same introducer to the same subject MUST contribute at most one
count. When `d = 0`, the threshold policy MUST reject every subject because no
final trust-edge hop fits inside the bound. Threshold policy does not
special-case root subjects; a root subject is accepted only if the same
`k`-introducer rule is met.

r[properties.web-of-trust.threshold-dedup]
For fixed trust roots, evaluation time, depth bound, threshold `k`, and
subject `S`, once one active direct trust edge from introducer `I` to `S` has
already been counted, any later active direct trust edge from that same
introducer to `S` MUST leave both the remaining qualifying distinct-introducer
count and the final threshold accept/reject result unchanged. Equivalently,
replacing multiple such same-introducer final hops with a single counted edge
MUST not change the threshold outcome.

## seL4 ASID Pool

r[sel4-asid.uniqueness]
A successful ASID allocation MUST make the returned ASID live for the
requesting address-space object ID, change only that returned slot, and leave
all other live ASID ownership unchanged. One owner MAY hold multiple live
ASIDs, but each live ASID MUST be bound to at most one live owner at a time.

r[sel4-asid.release-state]
A valid release MUST require an exact `(asid, owner)` match, return success,
clear only the released ASID slot, and leave all unrelated live ownership
unchanged. Invalid, out-of-range, mismatched-owner, or duplicate release MUST
return failure and leave pool ownership unchanged.

r[sel4-asid.reuse]
A released ASID MAY be reused later, but only after the release step has
cleared the prior live binding for that numeric ASID.

r[sel4-asid.pool-bounds]
Allocation MUST succeed whenever some free ASID exists, return only ASIDs in
`0..capacity-1`, and fail exactly when no free ASIDs remain. Failed allocation
MUST leave pool ownership unchanged, including the zero-capacity case.

## seL4 Capability Rights

r[sel4-cap-rights.attenuation]
A derived capability MUST NOT grant any right absent from its source
capability. Copy MAY preserve rights and masking MAY drop rights, but
attenuation MUST NOT add authority.

r[sel4-cap-rights.operation-gates]
Kernel operations MUST require the corresponding authority on the acting
capability. Send requires send authority, receive requires receive authority,
grant-like transfer requires grant authority, mapping requires map authority,
and control operations require control authority.

r[sel4-cap-rights.masking]
Rights masking MUST be idempotent and monotone. Applying the same mask twice
MUST equal applying it once, and masking with a smaller mask MUST NOT produce
a larger rights set.

## seL4 CSpace Lookup

r[sel4-cspace.lookup]
CSpace lookup MUST resolve a slot by guarded radix traversal. Each level MUST
check the guard, consume the matching guard depth plus one slot-selection
segment, and select exactly one child slot within the current CNode.

r[sel4-cspace.unique-slot]
A successful lookup MUST identify exactly one slot, and that slot MUST be
within the bounds of the resolved CNode.

r[sel4-cspace.failure-no-mutation]
A failed lookup MUST NOT modify CSpace state, consumed-depth accounting, or
capability contents.

## seL4 Capability Derivation Tree

r[sel4-cdt.structure]
Capability derivation MUST form an acyclic parent-child relation over live
capabilities. Copy and mint create a new live child of the source capability,
and the source capability remains live.

r[sel4-cdt.move]
Moving a capability to a different slot MUST preserve its derivation ancestry
and descendant set.

r[sel4-cdt.revoke]
Revoking a capability MUST remove exactly the live target subtree,
including the target root itself, while preserving siblings, ancestors
outside that subtree, and unrelated branches.

r[sel4-cdt.recycle]
Recycling a capability MUST succeed only for a live leaf capability and MUST
clear exactly that capability while preserving all other live nodes.

## seL4 Endpoint IPC

r[sel4-endpoint.rendezvous]
When a sender and receiver are both available on the same endpoint, the
kernel MUST match exactly one sender with exactly one receiver and wake both
threads. Public send/receive helpers may require caller TCB IDs that are not
already queued on that endpoint.

r[sel4-endpoint.queue-discipline]
Unmatched waiters on an endpoint MUST preserve queue order under match and
cancellation. Cancelling a blocked sender or blocked receiver MUST remove
only that waiter from its queue.

r[sel4-endpoint.badge]
A successful endpoint send/receive rendezvous MUST deliver the matched
sender capability's badge to the matched receiver.

## seL4 Fault IPC

r[sel4-fault-ipc.preservation]
Encoding a structured fault into an IPC-visible message and then decoding it
MUST recover the same fault class and preserved payload fields.

r[sel4-fault-ipc.delivery]
A modeled fault delivery step MUST place the encoded fault information into
the configured handler context so the handler can recover the original fault
record.

r[sel4-fault-ipc.payload]
Fault payload fields preserved by the model, including the instruction
pointer, MUST remain unmodified across encode/decode and delivery.

## seL4 Notification

r[sel4-notification.pending-badge]
A notification object MUST accumulate undelivered badge bits by bitwise OR of
all delivered signals that have not yet been consumed.

r[sel4-notification.consume]
Waiting or polling a signaled notification MUST return exactly the pending
badge value being delivered and consume that delivered pending state.

r[sel4-notification.binding]
If a notification is bound to a TCB, delivery eligibility and wakeup MUST
respect that binding.

## seL4 Reply Capability

r[sel4-reply.one-shot]
A reply capability created by a call MUST authorize at most one successful
reply. After reply, the reply capability MUST NOT be reusable.

r[sel4-reply.pairing]
A live reply capability MUST remain associated with the caller and callee pair
that created it. It MUST NOT be used to reply to a different caller.

r[sel4-reply.invalidate]
Revocation or cancellation MUST invalidate a live reply capability so no later
reply may succeed through it.

## seL4 IRQ Control

r[sel4-irq.binding]
Each IRQ line MUST have at most one live handler binding at a time.

r[sel4-irq.masking]
An IRQ that is masked MUST NOT be deliverable even if it is pending.

r[sel4-irq.ack]
Acknowledgement MUST clear or consume the abstract pending delivery state for
the IRQ being acknowledged.

## seL4 TCB States

r[sel4-tcb.state]
A TCB MUST be in exactly one legal state: runnable, running, blocked on send,
blocked on receive, blocked on notification, blocked on reply, restart, or
inactive.

r[sel4-tcb.blocking-object]
Every blocked TCB state MUST identify the kernel object responsible for the
block.

r[sel4-tcb.transitions]
Block, wake, restart, and deactivate operations MUST move a TCB only along
allowed state transitions.

## seL4 Ready Queues

r[sel4-ready-queue.consistency]
A runnable TCB MUST appear in exactly one ready queue at its runnable priority,
and a TCB present in a ready queue MUST be runnable.

r[sel4-ready-queue.selection]
Scheduler selection MUST choose a runnable TCB from a highest-priority
non-empty ready queue.

r[sel4-ready-queue.order]
Within one priority queue, enqueue, dequeue, and remove operations MUST
preserve the relative order of unaffected TCBs.

## seL4 VSpace Mappings

r[sel4-vspace.map]
Installing a mapping into a VSpace MUST respect object alignment and MUST NOT
create overlapping live mappings in that VSpace.

r[sel4-vspace.unmap]
Unmapping MUST remove exactly the targeted mapping and leave unrelated
mappings unchanged.

r[sel4-vspace.rights]
Effective mapping rights MUST be no greater than the rights carried by the
capability used to install the mapping.

## TLB Shootdown

r[tlb-shootdown.freshness]
After a single-page shootdown completes, every targeted core MUST have the
stale cached translation removed for the target page.

r[tlb-shootdown.termination]
Under the responsiveness assumption, acknowledgments MUST make monotone
progress toward completion and completion MUST hold exactly when all
required acknowledgments have been recorded.

r[tlb-shootdown.initiator-safety]
The shootdown protocol MUST report completion only after every required
acknowledgment has been recorded, so callers may use completion as the guard
for later effects outside this module.

r[tlb-shootdown.self-invalidation]
The initiating core MUST invalidate its own cached translation for the target
page before waiting on other cores.

r[tlb-shootdown.isolation]
Handling a shootdown for one target page MUST NOT modify cached translations
for any different page.

r[tlb-shootdown.range]
Range invalidation MUST apply the single-page invalidation rule to every page
in `[start, end)`, preserve pages outside the range, be identity on empty
ranges, and match the single-page rule on singleton ranges.

## seL4 Invocation Decode

r[sel4-invocation.decode-soundness]
Invocation decode MUST return a typed kernel invocation only when the supplied
message shape, looked-up capability kinds, and rights satisfy that label's
preconditions. In this repo's starter set, the modeled typed invocations are
endpoint send, endpoint receive, frame map, and untyped retype. For frame-map,
authority is checked on the primary frame capability; the secondary VSpace
capability is a typed root reference in this abstract decode surface.

r[sel4-invocation.reject]
Malformed messages, wrong-type capabilities, missing required secondary
capabilities, or missing required rights MUST cause decode failure with no
typed invocation result. Decode-level malformed checks reject zero size / zero
alignment in the starter set, while exact alignment and layout validity remain
downstream obligations of the modeled operation modules.

r[sel4-invocation.no-invented-authority]
A successful decode MUST mention only object identifiers already present in the
supplied decode context. Endpoint and untyped invocations use the primary
capability object, and frame-map uses only the primary frame object plus the
supplied secondary VSpace object.

## seL4 Kernel Invariants

r[sel4-invariants.compose]
The kernel state MUST satisfy one composed invariant covering at least
object-reference validity, capability derivation-tree well-formedness, CSpace
root and slot validity, TCB state legality, ready-queue consistency,
untyped-child ownership and disjointness, ASID pool well-formedness, VSpace
mapping consistency, and IRQ binding uniqueness.

r[sel4-invariants.decomposition]
The composed kernel invariant MUST decompose into named sub-invariants so local
proofs can depend only on the obligations they use. For this repo's starter
surface, the named obligations are object-reference validity, CDT
well-formedness, CSpace validity, TCB legality, scheduler consistency,
untyped ownership and top-level disjointness, ASID pool well-formedness,
VSpace consistency, and IRQ uniqueness.

r[sel4-invariants.step-preservation]
Each modeled primitive step in this change's initial preservation set MUST
preserve the composed kernel invariant whenever its explicit preconditions
hold. The initial set is endpoint send that blocks a running sender on an
empty receive queue, endpoint send that rendezvous-matches a queued receiver
and wakes it onto the ready queue, and untyped revoke that clears one untyped
object's live children.

r[sel4-invariants.preservation-matrix]
The seL4 invariant layer MUST maintain a local preservation matrix for modeled kernel steps. Each matrix entry MUST identify the step name, required prestate facts, mutated state fields, unchanged state fields, consumed sub-invariants, and proof or test evidence that links the entry back to `kernel_invariant_spec`.

r[sel4-invariants.step-preservation-expansion]
The seL4 invariant layer SHOULD expand the modeled preservation set around endpoint, TCB, ready-queue, and untyped interactions. Every accepted step in this expanded set MUST preserve `kernel_invariant_spec` whenever its stated preconditions hold, and rejected or out-of-scope requests MUST preserve the prestate without mutating global kernel state.

## Fetch-and-Add

r[fetch-add.semantics]
Fetch-and-add MUST return the old cell value and the new cell value after
applying the chosen arithmetic variant.

r[fetch-add.identity]
Fetch-and-add with addend zero MUST leave the cell unchanged and return the
original value.

r[fetch-add.commutativity]
Applying two fetch-and-add operations with addends `a` and `b` MUST yield the
same final cell value regardless of order for both wrapping and saturating
variants.

r[fetch-add.associativity]
Sequential fetch-and-add with addends `a` then `b` MUST yield the same final
cell value as one fetch-and-add with the combined addend for both wrapping and
saturating variants.

r[fetch-add.monotonicity]
For wrapping arithmetic, a positive addend without overflow MUST strictly
increase the cell value.

r[fetch-add.cas-refinement]
Wrapping fetch-and-add MUST refine a single successful compare-and-swap that
uses the old value as expected and the wrapped sum as desired.

r[fetch-add.wrapping]
The wrapping-add helper MUST satisfy modular arithmetic over `u64`, including
commutativity, identity, and the `u64::MAX + 1 == 0` overflow case.

r[fetch-add.saturating]
The saturating-add helper MUST clamp at `u64::MAX` and remain fixed once
saturated.

r[fetch-add.fetch-sub]
Fetch-sub MUST equal wrapping fetch-and-add with the two's-complement negation
of the subtrahend, and add/sub round-trips MUST restore the original value in
non-wrapping cases.

## seL4 Untyped Memory

r[sel4-untyped.retype]
Retyping an untyped region into typed kernel objects MUST conserve address
space, and every created child region MUST lie wholly within the parent
untyped region.

r[sel4-untyped.child-layout]
Live child objects derived from one untyped parent MUST satisfy their required
alignment and MUST NOT overlap one another.

r[sel4-untyped.reclaim]
Revoking or resetting an untyped object MUST remove all live children and
restore the parent to an empty-child reclaimed state.

## Choreography

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.type]
Choreography payload positions MUST use a distinct `PayloadTag` structure over
the complete `u32` value domain. Role and branch-label representations MUST
remain `u32` aliases during this pilot.

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.preservation]
The typed payload boundary MUST preserve existing well-formedness, projection,
merge, projectability, global-step, local-step, duality, choice-agreement, and
step-correspondence semantics for equal raw payload values.

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.validation]
Full-library Verus verification MUST pass without a new external body,
assumption, unverified public function, or proof-gap bridge.

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.evidence]
The pilot MUST include positive semantic tests, negative runtime tests, and
compile-fail evidence for invalid cross-domain payload construction.

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.docs]
Canonical requirements, source annotations, test annotations, public API
documentation, and accepted Cairn text MUST describe the typed payload boundary.

r[newtypes.choreography-payload.scope]
The pilot MUST NOT migrate `RoleId` or `LabelId`, add payload validation, alter
choreography semantics, or require newtypes for all verified identifiers.

r[choreography.value_ownership.identity]
Owned choreography values MUST use a distinct `ValueId` structure over the
complete `u32` domain. Roles, labels, and payload tags MUST NOT enter a value
identity position without explicit `ValueId` construction.

r[choreography.value_ownership.state]
An admitted finite ownership state MUST list represented values in strict
`ValueId` order. Each represented value MUST have exactly one owner entry.
Admission MUST reject duplicate and out-of-order values.

r[choreography.value_ownership.transfer]
An owned-transfer step MUST succeed only when source and destination differ and
the source owns the selected value. Success MUST advance to the stored
continuation and atomically replace that value's owner with the destination.
Failure MUST return no replacement choreography or ownership state.

r[choreography.value_ownership.conservation]
A successful owned-transfer step MUST preserve ownership-state normalization
and entry count. It MUST change only the selected owner, exclude the former
owner, and preserve every unrelated value owner.

r[choreography.value_ownership.boundary]
Owned-transfer evidence MUST describe only an atomic semantic owner change over
supplied finite facts. It MUST NOT claim transport delivery, persistence,
memory reclamation, authorization, exactly-once execution, or liveness.

r[choreography.value_ownership.evidence]
The ownership core MUST include positive, negative, compile-fail, and property
evidence for identity separation, admission, transfer, conservation, and stale
source rejection.

r[choreography.value_ownership.validation]
Ownership proofs MUST constrain the production admission and transfer
implementations. Full-library verification MUST preserve prior choreography
theorems without a new trusted bridge, assumption, or proof gap.

r[choreography.participants]
Finite choreography primitives MUST operate on exact `u32` role identifiers
and branch labels plus typed `PayloadTag` metadata. A communication or owned-
transfer prefix is well formed only if `from != to`. A choice is well formed
only if its branch
list is non-empty and its branch labels are pairwise distinct in strict
increasing order. `participants(choreo)` MUST contain exactly the roles that
appear as communication endpoints or as a branch decider in `choreo`.

r[choreography.communication]
A global communication prefix
`Comm { from, to, label, payload_tag, next }` MUST denote one exact
point-to-point interaction from `from` to `to` carrying the exact symbolic
message metadata `(label, payload_tag)` and continuing with the exact stored
continuation `next`. An `OwnedTransfer` prefix MUST additionally preserve one
exact `ValueId`; its ownership effect is defined only by the ownership step.

r[choreography.merge]
For a non-decider role, local branch projections over exact local nodes
`End`, `Send`, `Recv`, `SendOwned`, `RecvOwned`, `InternalChoice`, and `Offer`
MUST merge by a total helper
`merge_local(decider, left, right) -> Option<LocalChoreo>`.
Identical communication heads merge only when direction, peer, label, and
payload tag all match. Owned heads MUST also match the exact value identity.
A successful prefix merge keeps that exact head and recursively merges its
continuations.
Distinct `Recv` heads from the decider with distinct labels MUST merge into one
normalized `Offer` from that decider whose branch labels stay in strict
increasing order. `Offer` heads from the same decider MUST merge by sorted
label-set union, recursively merging shared labels and preserving unshared
labels. Every other head conflict MUST fail the merge. Merge recursion MUST use
an explicit structurally decreasing local-size measure, and successful merges of
well-formed inputs MUST preserve local branch-order invariants.

r[choreography.projectability]
A finite choreography MUST be projectable exactly when it is well formed and,
for every choice and every non-decider role appearing in at least one branch,
that role's branch projections admit the exact projection-side merge: preserve
any shared local communication or owned-transfer prefix common to every branch
in stored order, and when behavior first diverges, expose an `Offer` from the
decider keyed by
the stored global branch labels for the remaining branch-local continuations.
If a projectable choreography takes one global head step, the post-step
choreography MUST remain projectable.

r[choreography.projection]
For every projectable finite choreography `g` and role `r`,
`project_endpoint(r, g)` MUST be a preconditioned-total helper that returns the
exact local view implied by `g`: `End -> End`; a communication prefix projects
to `Send` for the sender, `Recv` for the receiver, and the projected
continuation for every uninvolved role; an owned-transfer prefix projects to
`SendOwned` for the source, `RecvOwned` for the destination, and the projected
continuation for every uninvolved role; a choice projects to a normalized
`InternalChoice` for the decider; and a choice projects for every non-decider
role to the exact outer-label-preserving merge of the per-branch projections,
preserving any shared local prefix and introducing an `Offer` from the decider
whose branch labels are the stored global choice labels exactly at the first
branch-dependent point. A role outside `participants(g)` MUST project to `End`.

r[choreography.steps]
A projectable finite choreography MUST have exact one-step global and local
semantics. `global_comm_step` returns `Some(next)` exactly on a global `Comm`
head. `global_choice_step(g, label)` returns `Some(branch_l)` exactly when the
head is a `Choice` carrying branch label `label`. `local_send_step` and
`local_recv_step` return `Some(next)` exactly on `Send` and `Recv` heads.
`owned_transfer_step` also requires current ownership and returns the exact
continuation plus the updated ownership state. `local_send_owned_step` and
`local_recv_owned_step` return `Some(next)` only on their matching owned heads.
`local_internal_choice_step` and `local_offer_step` return `Some(branch_l)`
exactly when the head is `InternalChoice` or `Offer` carrying label `label`.
Missing labels or wrong-head calls MUST return `None`. Sender and receiver
heads, and any currently exposed `InternalChoice` or `Offer` heads, MUST stay
aligned with the exact endpoint projection of the post-step choreography.
Roles hidden behind shared prefixes MUST stay aligned without fabricating a
spurious local head step.

r[choreography.value_transfer_projection.shape]
A projectable owned-transfer prefix MUST project to an exact `SendOwned` head
for its source and an exact `RecvOwned` head for its destination. Both heads
MUST preserve the peers, label, payload tag, value identity, and continuation.
Every uninvolved role MUST project through to the continuation.

r[choreography.value_transfer_projection.merge]
Owned local heads MUST merge only when direction, peer, label, payload tag, and
value identity match exactly. Every owned-head mismatch MUST fail merge.

## Choreography Cross-Module Properties

r[properties.choreography-duality]
For any projectable communication prefix, projection to the sender and
receiver MUST yield exact dual local heads: the sender sees
`Send { peer = receiver, ... }` and the receiver sees
`Recv { peer = sender, ... }` with the same exact `label` and `payload_tag`.

r[properties.choreography_transfer_correspondence]
For every projectable owned-transfer prefix admitted by a normalized ownership
state, the production global step and matching projected local steps MUST agree
on source, destination, label, payload tag, value identity, and continuation.
The global result MUST satisfy ownership conservation.

r[properties.choreography_transfer_exclusion]
After a successful transfer moves one value from source to destination, a later
step over the unchanged result MUST reject the former source for that value and
MUST return no fabricated ownership state.

r[properties.choreography-choice-agreement]
For any projectable choice with decider `D` and global branch-label set `L`,
the decider's local projection MUST expose exactly `L` as a normalized
`InternalChoice`. Every non-decider role whose branch behavior is identical
across all branches MUST collapse to that exact common local behavior. Every
other non-decider role MUST preserve any exact shared local prefix produced by
projection-side merge and, at the first exposed `Offer` from `D` if one
appears, MUST expose exactly `L`.

r[properties.choreography-step-correspondence]
If a projectable choreography takes one global head step to `g'`, then the
projected local views MUST stay exactly aligned with `project_endpoint(_, g')`.
Sender and receiver heads, and any currently exposed `InternalChoice` or
`Offer` heads, MUST take one matching local step to those exact endpoint
projections. Roles whose projection already collapses the global head behind a
shared prefix or identical behavior MUST already equal the corresponding
endpoint projection without inventing an extra local step.

## ChaosControl Coverage

r[chaoscontrol-coverage.regions]
A coverage bitmap MUST be a 65536-byte array partitioned into three exact,
non-overlapping contiguous regions: code `[0, 32768)`, assertion
`[32768, 49152)`, and schedule `[49152, 65536)`. Any public helper that
records hits into one region MUST leave the other two regions unchanged.

r[chaoscontrol-coverage.union]
Coverage merge MUST be exact pointwise max over u8 counters. A new-edge
query MUST return the exact u32 count of indices i with branch[i] > 0
and global[i] == 0.

r[chaoscontrol-coverage.classify]
Coverage classification MUST use the exact AFL bucket map:
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4..7 -> 4, 8..15 -> 8,
16..31 -> 16, 32..127 -> 32, 128..255 -> 128.

## ChaosControl Oracle

r[chaoscontrol-oracle.verdict]
Verdict evaluation MUST use hit_count > 0 as the meaning of "was hit".
always passes iff hit and no false. sometimes passes iff hit and at
least one true. reachable passes iff hit. unreachable passes iff never
hit. Every valid record maps to exactly one verdict.

r[chaoscontrol-oracle.accounting]
Aggregate accounting MUST preserve runs_satisfied <= runs_hit and
runs_hit == 0 iff hit_count == 0. Boolean records satisfy
hit_count == true_count + false_count and runs_hit <= hit_count.
Non-boolean records use exact canonical shapes.

## ChaosControl Scheduler

r[chaoscontrol-scheduler.turns]
Scheduler turn primitives require num_vcpus >= 1 and valid scheduler
state. Single-vCPU tick and advance are no-ops. SMP tick decrements
remaining by one and returns true on the positive-to-zero transition.
Advance moves to (active + 1) mod num_vcpus and reloads remaining.
Round-robin reloads default_quantum. Randomized advance consumes a
caller rng_word and assigns min_quantum + (rng_word mod (max_quantum -
min_quantum)) for [min_quantum, max_quantum).

r[chaoscontrol-scheduler.fingerprint]
The rolling schedule fingerprint updates by
fp.wrapping_mul(0x517cc1b72722_0a95).bitxor(active).bitxor(quantum)
on each SMP advance. Tick is fingerprint-neutral. apply_variant resets
fingerprint to 0.

## ChaosControl Fault Schedule

r[chaoscontrol-fault-schedule.replay]
A normalized fault schedule has unique ordinals, stable (time_ns, ordinal)
order, and 0 <= cursor <= len. drain_due(t) returns exactly the
not-yet-drained faults with time_ns <= t, advances cursor monotonically,
preserves the undrained suffix, and never re-delivers.

r[chaoscontrol-fault-schedule.subset]
Subset extraction clones the first occurrence of each in-bounds source
index, ignores out-of-bounds and repeated selections, carries source
ordinals, resets cursor to 0, and renormalizes by (time_ns, ordinal).

## ChaosControl Frontier

r[chaoscontrol-frontier.selection]
Frontier effective score is base_score / (1 + times_selected). Greedy
selection returns a maximal entry with lowest-index tie-break.
Re-selection is monotone non-increasing. Exec comparison uses exact
u64 cross-products.

## ChaosControl Input Tree

r[chaoscontrol-input-tree.alternatives]
Input-tree generation operates on normalized choice tuples with
n_options >= 2, original_value < n_options, arithmetic bounds on
sequence_id and n_options, and unique (vm_id, sequence_id) pairs.
Exact rational score uses constant-numerator denominator comparison.
Alternatives exclude the original value, use ascending distinct values,
and output is the exact prefix of the deterministic stream truncated
to min(budget, full_stream_len).

## ChaosControl Fault State

r[chaoscontrol-fault-state.quorum-health]
Valid fault states require 2 <= num_nodes <= 64, exact num_nodes x
num_nodes partition matrix, diagonal-false, and cleared high bits in
alive_mask. quorum_reachable is false when alive_count < majority and
otherwise true when some bidirectional alive pair exists.

r[chaoscontrol-fault-state.liveness-gate]
The healthy-period gate is alive_count == num_nodes AND
quorum_reachable.

## Cryptoshedding

r[cryptoshedding.tree-well-formedness]
well_formed_spec MUST accept only finite parent-indexed forests: every
parent reference is in bounds and no strict parent walk cycles back to
its start.

r[cryptoshedding.shed-definition]
shed MUST remove exactly the requested key from the keystore model and
leave the key tree unchanged.

r[cryptoshedding.chain-recoverability]
recoverable_spec MUST hold exactly when the given leaf is in bounds, is a
leaf, and every key on its leaf-to-root chain is present in the keystore.

r[cryptoshedding.shed-completeness]
Shedding any key on a leaf's chain, including the leaf itself, MUST make
that leaf irrecoverable.

r[cryptoshedding.shed-isolation]
Shedding a key not equal to the leaf and not on the leaf's strict
ancestor chain MUST leave that leaf's recoverability unchanged.

r[cryptoshedding.subtree-shedding]
For any in-bounds internal key K, shedding K MUST make every leaf in K's
subtree irrecoverable and MUST leave leaves outside that subtree
unaffected.

r[cryptoshedding.rotation-correctness]
rotate MUST update only the chosen leaf parent, make the new parent an
ancestor of that leaf in the rotated tree, and drive recoverability by
the rotated leaf's new chain.

r[cryptoshedding.idempotent-destruction]
Shedding the same key twice MUST leave both the keystore model and every
leaf's recoverability unchanged after the first shed.

## UCAN Signature

r[ucan-signature.round-trip]
Signing a message with a secret key and verifying with the corresponding
public key MUST succeed.

r[ucan-signature.key-binding]
Verifying a signature with a public key that does not correspond to the
signing secret key MUST fail.

lengths before invoking trusted Ed25519 crypto. Valid byte inputs MUST be
converted through checked constructors before signing, verification, or
public-key derivation.

## UCAN DID

r[ucan-did.round-trip]
Encoding key bytes as a did:key MUST use the canonical byte layout
`did:key:z ++ base58btc(varint(codec) ++ key_bytes)`. The public encode
result MUST preserve the exact key bytes, codec, and encoded bytes, and
public/spec-level decode of those encoded bytes MUST recover the original key
bytes and codec.

r[ucan-did.injective]
Distinct public keys encoded with the same codec MUST produce distinct
did:key strings.

r[ucan-did.prefix-valid]
An encoded did:key MUST always start with the string "did:key:z".

r[ucan-did.codec-preserved]
The codec recovered from decoding a did:key MUST match the codec used
for encoding.

r[ucan-did.varint-round-trip]
Encoding a value as a LEB128 varint and decoding MUST recover the
original value and consumed encoded length. Decoding an encoded varint
followed by trailing bytes MUST consume only the encoded varint prefix.

r[ucan-did.varint-bounded-u64]
DID varint decoding MUST use bounded u64 LEB128 semantics: a terminating
byte within the u64 byte budget returns a representable value and consumed
length; empty, continuation-only, overlong, and overflowing inputs return
None; non-minimal representable encodings remain accepted.

r[ucan-did.varint-rejects-empty]
Decoding a varint from an empty byte sequence or truncated continuation
sequence MUST return None.

r[verification-gaps.close-ucan-did-varint-decode]
The UCAN DID `varint_decode` implementation MUST be verified directly and
MUST NOT use `external_body`, `assume(...)`, `assume_specification[...]`,
`@verified-logic:no-ensures`, or `@verified-logic:exempt` replacement trust.

r[verification-gaps.inventory-after-ucan-did-varint]
The proof-gap inventory and README counts MUST remove the closed UCAN DID
`varint_decode` boundary and publish source-derived non-double-counted totals.

r[ucan-did.base58btc-round-trip]
Encoding bytes as base58btc and decoding MUST recover the original bytes.

r[ucan-did.base58btc-alphabet]
Base58btc decode MUST reject encoded byte sequences containing bytes outside
the Bitcoin/base58 alphabet before reaching the trusted codec core. The checked
alphabet excludes `0`, `O`, `I`, `l`, and non-alphanumeric separator bytes.

## UCAN Token

r[ucan-token.temporal-validity]
Temporal validity MUST be the conjunction of not-expired (with tolerance)
and not-before-satisfied (with tolerance).

r[ucan-token.self-delegation-rejected]
A UCAN token where issuer equals audience MUST be rejected.

r[ucan-token.attenuation-monotone]
Each child token's capabilities MUST be contained by its parent's
capabilities.

r[ucan-token.validation-sound]
If validate_envelope succeeds, then signature is valid, temporal constraints
hold, identity constraints hold, and required fields are present.

r[ucan-token.validation-complete]
If all sub-checks pass individually, validate_envelope MUST succeed.

r[ucan-token.issuer-present]
A validated UCAN MUST have a non-empty issuer DID.

r[ucan-token.audience-present]
A validated UCAN MUST have a non-empty audience DID.

r[ucan-token.attenuations-present]
A validated UCAN MUST have at least one capability in att.

r[ucan-token.canonical-bytes-assumed]
Canonical payload-byte construction is outside the scope of token-envelope
validation. The token layer MUST consume a caller-supplied signature-valid
result rather than prove canonical payload-byte derivation from the payload
struct.

## UCAN Compact

r[ucan-compact.signing-input-framing]
Canonical compact-token signing input MUST be exactly the encoded header bytes,
one `.` separator byte, and the encoded payload bytes. This structural helper
MUST NOT claim to prove base64url, JSON, hashing, or Ed25519 internals.

r[ucan-compact.three-part-framing]
Canonical compact-token framing MUST be exactly encoded header bytes, one `.`
separator byte, encoded payload bytes, one `.` separator byte, and encoded
signature bytes.

r[ucan-compact.parse-signature-boundary]
A compact-token envelope check MUST accept only when both the caller-supplied
compact bytes and caller-supplied signing input bytes match the canonical
framing over the same already-encoded parts. The check MUST remain data-only and
MUST NOT decode base64url, parse JSON, derive hashes, sign, verify signatures,
perform I/O, or read clocks.

r[ucan-compact.byte-equality]
Compact-token structural checks MUST compare finite byte vectors exactly by
length and byte value without normalization or lossy decoding.

## UCAN Ability

r[ucan-ability.subsumption-reflexive]
A non-glob ability MUST subsume itself.

r[ucan-ability.subsumption-transitive]
If pattern A subsumes pattern B and B subsumes ability C, then A MUST
subsume C.

r[ucan-ability.top-subsumes-all]
The top ability pattern "*" MUST subsume every ability.

r[ucan-ability.namespace-isolation]
Abilities in different top-level namespaces MUST NOT subsume each other
unless one is the top pattern.

r[ucan-ability.glob-one-level]
A single "*" in an ability pattern MUST match exactly one path segment,
not deeper nesting.

r[ucan-ability.containment-monotone]
If parent ability contains child ability, then everything the child
subsumes is also subsumed by the parent.

## UCAN Caveat

r[ucan-caveat.satisfaction-decidable]
For each concrete caveat type, satisfaction against a context MUST be
a total, decidable function.

r[ucan-caveat.set-conjunction]
A caveat set is satisfied if and only if every caveat in the set is
individually satisfied.

r[ucan-caveat.containment-monotone]
If parent contains child, then any context satisfying the child also
satisfies the parent.

r[ucan-caveat.set-containment-monotone]
If parent set contains child set, then any context satisfying the child
set also satisfies the parent set.

r[ucan-caveat.delegation-only-adds]
A child caveat set in a delegation chain MUST be at least as restrictive
as its parent.

r[ucan-caveat.intersection-sound]
The intersection of two caveat sets MUST imply both original sets.

r[ucan-caveat.intersection-minimal]
The intersection MUST not be more restrictive than the conjunction of
both sets.

## UCAN Claims Presence

r[ucan-claims-presence.required-fields]
Parsed UCAN claims presence admission MUST accept exactly when issuer, audience, attenuations, proof-list, expiration, and not-before presence facts are all true.

If two CIDs have the same byte representation, their version and codec
MUST be identical.

r[ucan-cid.multihash-digest-length]
The digest in a wrapped multihash MUST have the same length as the input
digest.

r[ucan-cid.multihash-round-trip]
Encoding a multihash to bytes and parsing MUST recover the original code
and digest.

r[ucan-cid.varint-round-trip]
Encoding a value as a varint and decoding MUST recover the original value.

r[ucan-cid.varint-rejects-empty]
Decoding a varint from an empty byte sequence MUST return None.

## UCAN Proof Chain

r[ucan-chain.issuer-audience-link]
Each hop in a delegation chain MUST have the child's issuer equal to the
parent's audience DID.

r[ucan-chain.signature-check]
Every token in the chain MUST carry a caller-provided valid-signature flag; the
structural chain checker MUST consume that flag without claiming to verify
cryptographic signature bytes or issuer keys.

r[ucan-chain.attenuation-narrowing]
Each delegation hop MUST narrow or preserve attenuations: every child capability
is contained in some parent capability, and public chain attenuation checking MUST
reject missing parent capabilities, resource escalation, and ability escalation.

r[ucan-chain.temporal-validity]
Every token in the chain MUST be temporally valid at the time of
evaluation.

r[ucan-chain.chain-validity]
A structural chain-validity checker MUST accept only non-empty chains whose hops
are linked, whose caller-provided signature-valid flags are all true, whose

structural checker MUST NOT claim to verify cryptographic signatures, DID
resolution, revocation, or external clock correctness.

r[ucan-chain.root-authority]

first (root) entry.

## UCAN Proof Traversal Transcript

r[ucan-proof-traversal.byte-equality]

## Hardware Output

r[hardware-output.ir]
The system MUST provide a finite hardware IR for synthesizable module shapes.
Every fixed-width value, boolean expression, module port, combinational
expression, register, clock, reset, and FSM state needed by the admitted subset
MUST be explicit in the IR metadata. IR admission MUST reject unsupported or
malformed shapes before evaluation or emission, and rejection MUST NOT expose
partial RTL output.

r[hardware-output.evaluator]
The system MUST provide pure deterministic evaluation semantics for admitted
hardware IR modules. The evaluator MUST compute combinational outputs from
explicit inputs and MUST compute the next registered or FSM state from explicit
current state and input values. Evaluation MUST reject missing inputs,
incompatible widths, invalid states, and malformed admitted-data boundaries
without panicking.

r[hardware-output.adapter-subset]
The system MUST expose explicit adapter eligibility metadata for Trellis
primitives that may lower to hardware IR. The first supported adapter subset
MUST include finite bitwise operations, bitfield operations, simple arithmetic
operations, and small FSM-style admission helpers. The adapter layer MUST reject
heap allocation, unbounded vectors, generated-hardware recursion, network or
file IO, async callbacks, distributed protocol execution, crypto trust-boundary
execution, and spec-only existential predicates.

r[hardware-output.adapter-refinement]
The system MUST ensure each supported Trellis-to-hardware adapter refines the
source Trellis semantics over its admitted finite input space. For every emitted
adapter, the hardware IR evaluator result MUST match the source spec or
executable helper result for the same admitted inputs, and rejected adapter
candidates MUST leave the source primitive unchanged.

r[hardware-output.adapter-emission]
The system MUST expose a pure adapter-emission planning decision that returns an
HDL emission request only when adapter eligibility, finite-input refinement,
emitted-shape support, and the requested emitter mode all pass. Planning MUST
fail closed for refined adapters without emitted HDL support, unsupported emitter
modes, unsupported adapter candidates, out-of-domain adapter inputs, evaluator
rejection, and emitter rejection, and MUST NOT expose a partial HDL request on
rejection.

r[hardware-output.verilog-emission]
The system MUST emit deterministic Verilog text only from admitted hardware IR
modules. Verilog emission MUST use canonical module, port, declaration,
assignment, and process ordering so repeated emission of the same IR produces
byte-identical output. Verilog emission MUST fail closed for unsupported IR
constructs.

r[hardware-output.systemverilog-emission]
The system MUST emit deterministic SystemVerilog text from admitted hardware IR
modules. SystemVerilog emission SHOULD use `logic`, `always_comb`, and
`always_ff` for supported combinational and registered modules, and MAY emit
assertion snippets for admitted safety properties. SystemVerilog emission MUST
preserve the same IR semantics as the Verilog emitter for shared supported
constructs.

r[hardware-output.testbench]
The system MUST generate optional testbench or vector collateral from the
hardware IR evaluator for admitted modules. Generated collateral MUST identify
the source module, input assignments, expected outputs or next states, and the
emitter mode under test. Collateral generation MUST be deterministic and MUST
NOT depend on clocks, filesystem order, random seeds, or external tool output.

r[hardware-output.validation]
The system MUST provide validation helpers or commands that classify Verilator,
Yosys, and SymbiYosys syntax/simulation/formal checks for generated HDL when
those tools are available. If a tool is unavailable, validation evidence MUST
record an explicit skipped-tool result; it MUST NOT report success for a check
that did not run.

r[hardware-output.backend-admission]
The system MUST expose a hardware-output backend admission decision requiring
IR admission, adapter subset admission, adapter refinement evidence,
deterministic emitter support, generated collateral eligibility, and validation
result recording before claiming that a Trellis primitive has HDL output
support. Backend admission MUST NOT imply timing closure, vendor implementation
quality, downstream synthesis preservation, or support for modules outside the
admitted adapter subset.

## Hardware Output Testing

r[hardware-output.testing.matrix]
The system MUST maintain a requirement-linked hardware-output test matrix. Each
hardware-output backend requirement MUST map to at least one positive test or
proof artifact and at least one negative test or proof artifact unless the
requirement explicitly documents why one side is inapplicable. Each mapped
artifact MUST carry a Tracey `r[verify ...]` marker for the covered requirement.

r[hardware-output.testing.fixtures]
The system MUST use deterministic fixture naming and metadata for
hardware-output tests. Source IR fixtures, golden HDL fixtures,
generated-vector fixtures, and validation evidence MUST identify the
requirement ID, emitted module name, emitter mode, and expected oracle source so
reviewers can trace each artifact back to the requirement it verifies.

r[hardware-output.testing.evaluator-oracle]
The system MUST test the pure hardware IR evaluator as the semantic oracle for
backend validation. Positive tests MUST cover admitted combinational modules,
registered modules, and FSM steps. Negative tests MUST cover missing inputs,
incompatible widths, invalid current states, malformed admitted-data boundaries,
and any evaluator rejection that should block generated collateral.

r[hardware-output.testing.emitter-golden]
The system MUST test Verilog and SystemVerilog emitters with deterministic
golden-output fixtures. Golden tests MUST cover canonical module ordering, port
ordering, declaration ordering, expression formatting, combinational
assignments, registered update blocks, reset behavior, reserved identifier
rejection, and unsupported-node rejection. Repeated emission of the same
admitted IR MUST produce byte-identical output.

r[hardware-output.testing.adapter-property]
The system MUST property-test or exhaustively finite-test each supported
Trellis-to-hardware adapter over admitted input domains. Adapter tests MUST
compare the source Trellis helper result with the lowered hardware IR evaluator
result and MUST include edge values for zero, maximum representable values,
width boundaries, state boundaries, and rejected out-of-domain candidates.

r[hardware-output.testing.fail-closed]
The system MUST test fail-closed behavior for the hardware-output backend.
Unsupported adapters, malformed IR, unsupported emitter constructs, evaluator
rejections, invalid validation inputs, and unavailable output destinations MUST
produce explicit errors and MUST NOT write partial HDL, partial testbenches,
partial vectors, or misleading success evidence.

r[hardware-output.testing.tool-evidence]
The system MUST classify external HDL tool validation outcomes as pass, fail,
or skipped. Tool evidence MUST name the tool, invocation class or input
artifact, result classification, and reason for failure or skip. Missing
Verilator, Yosys, or SymbiYosys MUST be recorded as skipped with an
unavailable-tool reason and MUST NOT be reported as success.

r[hardware-output.testing.tracey-gates]
The system MUST require Tracey and Cairn gate evidence before claiming
hardware-output test coverage is complete. Hardware-output test completion MUST
include focused backend tests, generated fixture checks, Verus proof checks for
touched verified modules, Tracey uncovered and untested queries, Cairn
validation, Cairn proposal/design/tasks gates, and cargo/clippy checks as
applicable to touched Rust code.

## Spreadsheet Logic

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.address]
The system MUST provide finite spreadsheet sheet-bound and cell-address
envelopes that record row bounds, column bounds, cell coordinates, and
deterministic address-admission results. A checked cell address MUST be admitted
only when both coordinates are inside the declared finite sheet bounds, and
rejected address admission MUST leave prior admitted sheet metadata unchanged.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.range]
The system MUST provide finite rectangular-range envelopes that normalize two
admitted endpoint addresses into a canonical rectangle, expose deterministic
range membership, and expand only to admitted cell coordinates inside the
declared sheet bounds.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.formula]
The system MUST provide a finite spreadsheet formula and value model covering
blank values, exact numeric values, booleans, text, explicit errors, constants,
cell references, rectangular ranges, arithmetic operations, and finite aggregate
operations. Formula admission MUST reject syntactically or structurally invalid
formulas before dependency extraction or evaluation.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.dependency]
The system MUST provide deterministic dependency-extraction predicates that
return exactly the finite set of precedent cell coordinates named by an admitted
formula, including all cells contained in admitted referenced ranges. Dependency
extraction MUST be pure over formula structure and declared sheet bounds, and
MUST NOT depend on current formatted values, cached results, external workbook
files, clocks, or volatile runtime state.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.cycle]
The system MUST reject spreadsheet formula sets whose dependency graph contains
a cycle before formula evaluation begins. An admitted formula set MUST have an
acyclic dependency graph over the finite formula-cell coordinates and their
extracted precedents.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.recalc]
The system MUST provide recalculation-order predicates that admit only finite
orders where each selected formula cell appears after every selected formula
precedent required by its extracted dependency set. Successful recalculation
order admission MUST refine the acyclic dependency graph and MUST NOT introduce
formula cells outside the declared finite sheet metadata.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.dirty-propagation]
The system MUST provide dirty-cell propagation predicates that include each
changed cell and every formula cell reachable from changed cells through reverse
spreadsheet dependencies, while excluding formula cells that are not reachable
dependents under the admitted finite dependency graph.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.error]
The system MUST provide explicit deterministic spreadsheet error envelopes for
bad references, division by zero, value-shape mismatches, and cycle rejection.
Error-producing checks MUST return the same error metadata for the same admitted
inputs, MUST NOT panic, and MUST NOT mutate admitted sheet, formula, dependency,
or recalculation metadata.

r[domain-primitives.spreadsheet.admission]
The system MUST provide a deterministic spreadsheet-admission composition that
requires address admission, range admission, formula admission, dependency
extraction, cycle rejection, recalculation-order admission, dirty-propagation
admission, and error-envelope determinism before any spreadsheet evaluation
claim is exposed.

## Runnable Proof Examples

r[runnable-proof-examples.basic]
The system MUST provide a deterministic proof example that demonstrates the
Trellis `spec fn` / runtime function / `ensures` refinement pattern through a
Verus command that succeeds and an isolated negative fixture that fails for the
expected proof reason.

r[runnable-proof-examples.commands]
The system MUST document exact positive, negative, wrapper, and opt-in commands
for runnable proof examples so users can reproduce both passing proof evidence
and expected failing proof evidence without treating the negative fixture as part
of the normal passing path.

## Proof-Evidence Bundles

r[proof-evidence-bundles.export]
The system SHOULD export deterministic proof-evidence bundle records that name
schema version, scope, requirement IDs, source/proof paths, verifier command,
proof outcome, Tracey coverage status, proof-gap references, BLAKE3 content
identities, maturity facts when available, scoped claims, and explicit non-claims.
A bundle MUST NOT grant release approval by itself.

r[proof-evidence-bundles.validation]
The system MUST validate proof-evidence bundles fail-closed for missing required
fields, stale BLAKE3 identities, unsupported schema versions, missing requirement
coverage, missing proof-gap references, and overbroad claims such as release
approval, whole-program correctness, certification, third-party conformance, or
production safety.

## Proof-Evidence IR Chain

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.contract]
The system MUST represent proof evidence as linked source envelopes, canonical proof evidence IR, and verifier receipts that bind source identity, proof IR identity, verifier receipt identity, declared property IDs, assumptions, dependencies, result status, and non-claims.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.verifier_receipt]
The system MUST bind proof result status to verifier identity, toolchain identity, solver identity, command identity, input roots, and result identity, and MUST reject proof evidence with an empty verifier identity, empty input roots, or an unsupported result status using deterministic diagnostics.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.assumptions]
The system MUST represent assumptions, trusted boundaries, external bodies, proof gaps, dependencies, requirement IDs, and property IDs as typed fields in proof evidence IR, and MUST change the evidence identity or report stale assumption linkage when the assumption set changes.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.handoff]
The system SHOULD emit a deterministic proof evidence-chain handoff that carries canonical source, proof IR, verifier receipt, and assumption identities plus non-claims so a consumer can canonicalize it without parsing Verus source.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.positive]
The system MUST accept proof evidence IR documents whose source identities, verifier receipt identities, chain identities, and handoff identities are consistent and BLAKE3-bound.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.negative]
The system MUST reject proof evidence that claims whole downstream system correctness, compiler correctness, verifier soundness, release eligibility, or properties outside the declared proof scope, and MUST mark recorded-only reference evidence without counting it as a promoted formal proof.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.evidence]
The implementation MUST include positive and negative evidence covering consistent linked evidence, missing verifier identity, unsupported result status, overbroad claims, stale chain identities, assumption drift, and inconsistent handoff identities.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.docs]
The system MUST document the proof evidence IR chain surface, commands, claim boundary, and non-claims in repository documentation and accepted Cairn spec text.

r[trellis.proof_evidence_bundles.proof_evidence_ir_chain.validation]
The change MUST capture validation evidence for focused Cargo tests, Verus verification, Tracey uncovered and untested checks, and Cairn validation and gates before archive.

## Proof Artifact Provenance

r[trellis.proof_artifact_provenance.identity]
Exportable Trellis proof artifacts MUST carry a stable artifact ID, canonical BLAKE3 metadata identity, source/proof input digests, verifier receipt digest, verifier/toolchain identity, normalized invocation, declared local property ID, verification status, and failure reason when the local proof did not pass.

r[trellis.proof_artifact_provenance.boundary]
Proof artifact provenance MUST state the checked Trellis-local property and exact content scope, MUST include non-claims excluding downstream certification, release eligibility, and whole-stack correctness, and MUST reject unsupported or overclaiming roles fail-closed.

r[trellis.proof_artifact_provenance.handoff]
Proof artifact handoff metadata MUST identify Trellis exports as downstream manual-review or reference inputs unless the downstream repo records its own verifier receipt; downstream-certified handoff roles without such a receipt MUST be rejected.

r[trellis.proof_artifact_provenance.fixtures]
The proof artifact provenance surface MUST include positive and negative fixtures covering passing local proof metadata, failing local proof metadata with a failure reason, stale digests, missing property scope, missing verifier identity, missing non-claims, unsupported claim roles, and downstream overclaims.

## Integration Adapters

r[integration-adapters.user-facing-adapters]
The system MUST provide deterministic user-facing adapter surfaces only when they
compose existing verified Trellis primitives or explicit pure cores, reject
malformed or out-of-subset inputs deterministically, and document supported
subsets, validation evidence, and non-goals without claiming full external
ecosystem conformance.

## Durable Reference Identity Separation

r[newtypes.durable-identities.types]
The typed durable reference model MUST use distinct structures for reference, value, type, codec, closure, and schema identities in every envelope, request, catalog, result, and conversion witness, so that cross-domain substitution fails to compile.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.invalid-inputs]
Each identity structure MUST retain the complete raw u64 value domain, including zero, so malformed finite metadata remains expressible and rejectable by explicit admission predicates; construction alone MUST NOT imply validity.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.preservation]
For equivalent raw field values, the typed implementation MUST preserve finite metadata, closure availability, missing-closure reporting, unpersist type matching, and conversion-witness admission results.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.evidence]
The change MUST include positive semantic tests, negative malformed-input tests, and compile-fail evidence for representative cross-domain substitutions.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.docs]
The change MUST update canonical requirements, source and test annotations, public documentation, and accepted Cairn text for every new identity boundary.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.validation]
The migration MUST pass focused and full Cargo tests, compile-fail checks, Clippy, full-library Verus, Tracey, proof-gap inventory, and Cairn validation without adding trusted proof boundaries.

r[newtypes.durable-identities.non-claims]
Identity wrappers MUST NOT be presented as cryptographic digests, collision-resistance evidence, persistence evidence, codec correctness, type-checker correctness, dependency retrieval, or migration execution; they provide domain separation and preserved finite-model admission behavior only.

## Parking-Lot Identity Separation

r[newtypes.parking-lot-identities]
The parking-lot core MUST use distinct `ParkKey` and `ThreadId` types. Each type
MUST support explicit raw construction and raw access without an implicit
conversion to the other identity domain.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-api]
Every public parking-lot core and raw-mutex function MUST use `ParkKey` for
queue positions and `ThreadId` for waiter or owner positions.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-semantics]
For equivalent raw values, typed parking-lot operations MUST preserve queue
validity, waiter uniqueness, waiter counts, requeue results, and raw-mutex
state transitions.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-evidence]
The change MUST include positive and negative runtime tests plus compile-fail
evidence for both directions of identity exchange.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-docs]
Canonical requirements, source annotations, tests, public module text, and
accepted Cairn text MUST describe the typed identity boundary.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-non-claims]
The identity types provide Rust domain separation only. They MUST NOT be
presented as a Verus, scheduler, blocking, fairness, or operating-system proof.

r[newtypes.parking-lot-validation]
The migration MUST pass focused and full Cargo tests, compile-fail checks,
Clippy, Tracey uncovered and untested checks, and Cairn validation before
archive.

## Bounded Modular Tree Fold

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.boundary]
Bend 0.2.38 and HVM2 2.0.22 MUST remain pinned external conformance references. Local Trellis proofs MUST NOT prove their implementations or generated artifacts.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.u24-domain]
The module MUST define named `u24` width, modulus, maximum, mask, and widened-sum bounds. Normalization MUST be closed, identity-preserving, and idempotent.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.u24-add]
Executable `u24` addition MUST accept admitted operands, avoid runtime overflow, stay in the domain, and equal mathematical addition modulo the named modulus.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.algebra]
Concrete `u24` wrapping addition MUST have verified zero-identity, commutativity, and associativity proof functions over its declared domain.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.admission]
The versioned profile MUST admit only non-empty power-of-two leaf vectors within a nonzero limit. It MUST reject invalid leaves and unrepresentable accounting deterministically.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.refinement]
The iterative sequential oracle and iterative adjacent-pair reducer MUST refine one ordered `u24` modular-sum specification for admitted input.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.equivalence]
A verified proof function MUST show that one adjacent-pair round preserves the ordered modular sum. The balanced result MUST equal the sequential result.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.work]
For admitted `n` leaves, the balanced schedule MUST shrink each nonterminal round and perform exactly `n - 1` abstract combines.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.evidence]
Proof evidence MUST bind source, requirements, proof functions, verifier, proof gaps, BLAKE3 identities, algorithm profile, executable oracle symbol, and downstream validation requirements.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.fixtures]
Positive, negative, boundary, and property tests MUST cover arithmetic, admission, singleton and multi-round reduction, exact work, stale handoffs, and three-oracle agreement.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.non-claims]
Evidence MUST NOT claim Bend, HVM2, generated-C, host-compiler, arbitrary-tree, benchmark, resource, interaction-count, release, or downstream-decoding correctness.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.docs]
The repository MUST document the public modules, exact external references, profile, oracle symbol, reproduction commands, proof handoff, and bounded claims.

r[bounded-modular-tree-fold.validation]
Closeout MUST pass focused tests, property tests, full Verus, Tracey, proof evidence, proof gaps, catalogs, Clippy, Octet, Nix, and Cairn gates.

## Aeneas Cross-Verifier Pilot

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.provider_consumption]
The pilot MUST consume public Octet Aeneas revision `b9b4b4044142820a07dc00332c36e07d1e1c4711`. It MUST bind the reviewed provider, policy, compatibility, and consumer-contract identities.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.exact_source]
The pilot MUST select `src/arithmetic.rs::abs_diff` from normal Cargo macro erasure. It MUST reject copied or rewritten proof targets.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.translation_manifest]
The pilot MUST bind one non-errorful LLBC declaration to one generated Lean declaration through measured `translation.json` bytes. Charon `def_id` values MUST remain run-local.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.feasibility]
Typed stage observations MUST classify the exact-source attempt as supported, blocked, or failed. Only complete reviewed unsupported evidence MAY produce blocked status.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.generated_boundary]
Generated LLBC, translation metadata, and Lean definitions MUST remain separate from maintained theorem source. Freshness checks MUST bind every stage.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.theorem_map]
The pilot MUST map symmetry and self-zero to exact requirement, source, statement, model, Verus symbol, Lean symbol, and receipt identities.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.theorem_adequacy]
Selected theorem source MUST be non-vacuous and free of forbidden proof shortcuts. The trust closure MUST list all observed axioms.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.resource_budget]
Each provider stage MUST use the named timeout, retained-log, retained-artifact, environment, and network-denial policy. Exhaustion MUST produce failure.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.manifest]
The Trellis manifest MUST link separate Verus and Aeneas facts through one runtime source identity. It MUST NOT merge their authority.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.negative_evidence]
Lean MUST reject the false theorem. Octet adequacy MUST reject the vacuous theorem. Tamper fixtures MUST fail before proof promotion.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.claim_boundary]
Evidence MUST NOT claim verifier independence, semantic equivalence, translation soundness, verifier soundness, whole-program correctness, or release eligibility.

r[trellis.aeneas_cross_verifier.final_validation]
Closeout MUST pass exact-source generation, both positive theorems, false and vacuous controls, trust audit, freshness, tamper, Octet, Verus, Tracey, Nix, and Cairn gates.

## Standalone Nickel Export Shell

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.source]
Release inputs MUST pin Nickel export revision `257fafc1c746f1faf156207043a4c826bfb16d49` and the exact Nickel 1.17.0 evaluator cohort. Release checks MUST reject floating or local overrides.

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.boundary]
Only Trellis checker shells MAY invoke the exporter, read source files, run Nickel, or write destinations. Verified modules and pure proof models MUST NOT gain that authority.

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.authority]
Trellis MUST retain policy meaning, proof-corpus semantics, Verus and Tracey gates, fixture expectations, destinations, and release decisions after export.

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.dual_run]
Legacy and standalone paths MUST use identical declared inputs. Verification policy, lifecycle YAML, and JSON contract outputs MUST match by exact bytes and BLAKE3 identity.

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.rollback]
Legacy checkers MUST remain required through one complete positive and negative cycle. Any output or diagnostic drift MUST keep legacy behavior authoritative and fail closed.

r[trellis.nickel_export_cutover.validation]
Validation MUST cover exact output, freshness, malformed requests, invalid contracts, stale and tampered outputs, path escape, symlinks, evaluator drift, secret markers, and proof or release overclaims.
